The camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party.

This time around is little different. There were encouraging signs in a painful defeat against Australia, a clinical edge - eventually - in a tight endgame against Argentina and a six-try victory over Georgia, a side that many of us expected would scrummage and scrap their way to a much closer scoreline than 43-16. Scotland's attacking game is improving, no question. Their ability to make things happen out of nothing is on the rise and the arrival of Huw Jones has been a boost. That Scottish midfield is showing serious depth now - Jones, Alex Dunbar, Duncan Taylor, Mark Bennett, Peter Horne, Matt Scott. That's as good as it has been, possibly forever. The Australia game showed that Scotland have the artillery to find space and the wit to score against the elite. It was the one that got away after the one that got away in the World Cup last year, but if they can learn the lessons then, come the Six Nations, it will have been worth the angst. Against Argentina, in a brutal and second-rate game, Scotland dug it out, which says something about their mental strength. On Saturday against the Georgians, they put the game to bed in little over 30 minutes after a terrible beginning. It is easy to see Scotland's upside, but just as easy to see their weaknesses. Their front-liners are strong and many of them have their best years ahead of them, but this is a paper-thin squad in terms of true Six Nations class. There has been added depth this autumn in the front row. Alasdair Dickinson and WP Nel remain the first-choice props but Allan Dell and Zander Fagerson have done themselves a power of good. Hamish Watson has been terrific and even if John Hardie was fit and well, Watson would surely be deemed the starting open-side flanker now. Magnus Bradbury was given a deserved crack against Argentina and did well in parts. Coach Vern Cotter spoke about the"}

Even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a Marine is reported KIA, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body, or if there even was a body. The U.S. government is still finding the missing from WWII, and it takes months to identify the remains.

Britain will not consider any children who arrive in the Jungle after the process of clearance began, she added, to discourage more from travelling to Calais. She told the Commons, 800 children had already been interviewed by UK officials in the camp - saying some interviews with children had to be \"paused\" for staff safety reasons.

So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English's talents didn't translate.

Zainab and her four-year-old sister Zeena both survived the attack on 5 September during their camping holiday. Mr Martin said he initially believed there had been a car accident after coming across the scene while cycling in the forest area. He told the BBC the car's engine was running when he arrived and he had to break a window on the vehicle to switch it off. \"At first I thought there's been a terrible accident between a cyclist and a car because there was a cyclist on the ground, more or less in front of the car, but there were things that didn't quite match because the cyclist's bike wasn't beside him, so as the minutes went on I started to change my opinion,\" he said. He saw three bodies in the car, and once he realised a crime had taken place, he was worried who might still be around. \"There was a lot of blood and heads with bullet holes in them,\" he said. \"I've never seen people who've been shot before... but it seemed to me just like a Hollywood scene, and if someone had said 'cut' and "}

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite."}

It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. That's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite.

They are divided into four classes (Type I \u2013 IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages."}

Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981\u20131037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt."}

We must find ways to encourage experimentation in an age where our education system has a tendency to expect young people to move away from practical learning as they grow up and to become more theoretical and abstract. Why does this matter? Because we have a major skills shortage - by 2022 the UK will need at least 1.82 million new engineering, science and technology professionals. We need to inspire many more young people to take up careers in these crucial areas, which will pave the way for our future economic development. Engineering and science are evolving all the time.

In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers,"}

It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the \"\"director's cut\"\", or in this case, \"\"let's salvage whatever we can\"\" from this notorious box office flop. In releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. What kind of spy is Lili? How"}

And it got ugly.The authors of the replication study shared their findings \u2014 which they called an \"epic fail\" \u2014 in a blog post prior to publication; Schnall identified potential problems with the replication and with the peer-review process (or its absence); more and more researchers analyzed and re-analyzed the data in question; some applauded the unfolding saga as scientific progress; some thought things got mean-spirited and personal. And in a widely discussed tweet, Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert described the \"replication police\" as \"shameless little bullies.\"In the new video \u2014 from a talk she gave to a group of social scientists in September \u2014 Schnall considers the different levels of scrutiny received by different researchers and for different findings.

A problem with insulin production in the brain is thought to result in the formation of protein \"plaque\"\u2014not unlike that which is found among suffers of Type 1 (insulin-dependant) and Type 2 diabetes (insulin-resistant). But in the case of diabetes Type 3, plaque appears in the brain and leads to memory loss and problems forming memories.What HappensWhen it comes to the body, insulin is responsible for helping to convert food to energy. The brain uses insulin, too, but it's thought insulin's primary purpose in the brain is to form memories at synapses (the spaces where cells in the brain communicate), notes Time.com. Neurons save space for insulin receptors; insulin makes way for memories to form. In order for the brain to keep making more brain cells, it needs insulin. When insulin receptors flee\u2014as is the case with sufferers of diabetes Type 3\u2014the brain does not receive the energy it needs to form memories.Alzheimer's ConnectionAccording to a research team at Northwestern University, insulin may prevent or slow memory loss among those with Alzheimer's disease by protecting the synapses that form memory.

A jury found the former nurse guilty of homicide by child abuse the day before and she could have faced up to life behind bars.Her lawyer said she will appeal and it's likely the case will be tied up for years to come. Both the prosecutor and Greene's lawyer agree no mother has ever been prosecuted in the United States for killing her child through a substance transmitted in breast milk.Greene's daughter Alexis was born healthy, but was found dead in her parents' bed just 46 days after she was born in November 2010.An autopsy found a level of morphine in the baby's body that a pathologist testified could have been lethal for an adult. With no needle marks on the child's body, authorities decided the drugs must have gotten into the infant through her mother's milk, prosecutor Barry Barnette said.A review of her medical records showed Greene carefully hid her pregnancy from her primary doctor. After a home pregnancy test showed she was pregnant, she told her primary doctor she needed to go to a gynecologist for a birth control. She then got prenatal care from"}

There has been much talk of the new \"see now, buy now\" trend that upends the traditional system whereby fashion houses showcase their new styles but only deliver them to the market several months later. So what exactly has changed and why? London Fashion Week comes around twice a year (in September and February), and, as the people behind it are keen to emphasise, it is about a great deal more than hats and hem lengths. It is the industry's trade show: new styles are launched, fashion journalists take copious notes, and buyers put in orders for stock. According to the organisers, the fashion industry contributes \u00a328bn to the UK economy and is growing, currently providing jobs for 880,000 people. And in an ever noisier world, it can help let your voice be heard, according to Peter Ruis, chief executive of Jigsaw - showing at Fashion Week for the first time. He says: \"Twenty years ago, there were maybe 300 to 400 brands in Europe. \"Now, there are millions of brands everywhere, so London Fashion Week gives us a chance for four days to be on the top of the agenda.\" In the old days, a designer would show new styles in the autumn that were meant to be worn the following spring. February's fashion shows looked ahead to the coming winter. It gave editors time to publish lots of glossy photos in monthly magazines and allowed the anticipation to build before the clothes arrived in store.

The modifications to power lines are taking place in areas where the birds have been known to nest or hunt for fishing. It involves moving the wires further apart, fitting rings on the lines to deter birds and making it harder for them to perch on transformer boxes which supply homes.

But the dispute between the two Middle Eastern nations has deep religious, historic and political roots. Iran and Saudi Arabia are on opposing sides of a more than 1,000-year old argument at the heart of Islam - between Sunnis and Shia. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, his followers split over who was his rightful heir. It is important not to overstate the division. Sunnis and Shia share fundamental beliefs, and have co-existed for centuries - the animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia is better understood in terms of a power struggle in the Middle East and beyond. But despite this, sectarianism is an ugly reality in many of the conflicts raging today. Iran and Saudi Arabia's status as leading exponents of Shia and Sunni Islam respectively have informed their foreign policies, with both sides forming alliances with countries who share their theologies - and backing militant groups in those that don't. Islam's ancient schism The recent rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia can be traced to the Iranian revolution of 1979, which saw a pro-Western leader toppled and Shia religious authorities taking over. Tehran began backing Shia militias and parties abroad, and Riyadh - concerned at the growing influence of a newly-strident Iran - strengthened links to other Sunni governments, including the formation of the Gulf Co-operation Council. The 1980s saw tensions between Saudi and Iran escalate - Saudi Arabia backed Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and after clashes at the hajj in 1987 killed hundreds of Iranian pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended diplomatic ties for three years. Another key milestone was the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the overthrow of Saddam Hussein saw a Shia-led government come to power in Riyadh's neighbour. The "}

The IPCC investigated the circumstances of the crash, including examining CCTV and in-car video footage. Nine officers and one member of police staff were served notice that their conduct was under investigation by the IPCC. One officer has since had six penalty points placed on his police driving licence. A headset used in the control room during the pursuit was also found to be faulty, according to the report. At the time of the collision several police vehicles were involved in the pursuit of the 19-year-old's Ford Fiesta which involved speeds of up to 100mph. The pursuit started when Mr Seddon, who was driving on a provisional licence without insurance, failed to stop for an officer. Mr Seddon, who had not been wearing a seat belt, was thrown into the road and hit by one of the pursuing vehicles. Last month, a jury inquest ruled there was insufficient reason to call off the pursuit. IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell described the crash as a \"tragic accident\".

It is a collection of the teachings of the Buddha expressed in clear, pithy verses. These verses were culled from various discourses given by the Buddha in the course of forty-five years of his teaching, as he travelled in the valley of the Ganges (Ganga) and the sub-mountain tract of the Himalayas. These verses are often terse, witty and convincing. Whenever similes are used, they are those that are easily understood even by a child, e.g., the cart's wheel, a man's shadow, a deep pool, flowers. Through these verses, the Buddha exhorts one to achieve that greatest of all conquests, the conquest of self; to escape from the evils of passion, hatred and ignorance; and to strive hard to attain freedom from craving and freedom from the round of rebirths. Each verse contains a truth (dhamma), an exhortation, a piece of advice.Dhammapada VersesDhammapada verses are often quoted by many in many countries of the world and the book has been translated into many languages. One of the earliest translations into English was made by Max Muller in 1870. Other translations that followed are those by F.L. Woodward in 1921, by Wagismara and Saunders in 1920, and by A.L. Edmunds (Hymns of the Faith) in 1902. Of the recent translations, that"}

Many of the delegates will stay in swish hotels nearby. This is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of \"cut and paste\" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy. The official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made. But its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: \"Chronically unstable and ungoverned\", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine. There has been some improvement. Piracy, which at its height cost $7bn (\u00c2\u00a35.4bn) a year, is much diminished, although there has been a recent resurgence. US drones, African Union troops, Western \"security advisers\" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will. A recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament. Somalia is in a \"pre-famine\" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died. But it is perhaps surprising that the current water shortage will not be a headline topic at the conference. The country is in the grip of its worst drought in decades. Four successive rainy seasons have failed. Even before you enter Burao Regional Hospital, in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland's drought-stricken Togdheer region, you hear the haunting, high-pitched wailing of malnourished children. One boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. \"His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition,\" says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. \"He will never recover.\" According to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening.

She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things."}

Bearded Warren Beatty plays a turn-of-the-century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel; once the profits start coming in, Beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action. Altman creates a solemn, wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place, but the action in this sorry little town is limited--most of the story being made up of vignettes--and Altman's pacing is deliberately slow. There's hardly a statement being made (just the opposite, in fact) and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds.

A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence.

James Keatings and another for Cummings were added in quick succession in the second half. It leaves Ayr at the bottom, three points behind next week's hosts, who lost 5-0 to St Mirren. Ayr looked nervous, but Neil Lennon's visitors started the game with intent and came close after only three minutes. Cummings sensed an opportunity after a mistake from the Ayr defence, but his right-footed effort came back out off the post. The striker was hungry for a goal and, following some skilful footwork by John McGinn, the midfielder whipped in a cross for Cumming to nod it home. It was two shortly after as Grant Holt's low cross was met at the back post by the oncoming Boyle to slide the ball under goalkeeper Greg Fleming. The second half was more of the same. McGinn and Boyle both came close with long distance efforts and Holt came inches away from connecting with a cut-back six yards out. Hibs' third came when McGinn found Cummings in space on the right and a simple ball set up well-positioned substitute Keatings to slip the ball through the legs of Fleming. Cummings wasn't done for the day and added his second and Hibs' fourth after Keatings turned supplier with a delightful through ball. Ian McCall's hosts rarely threatened, with visiting goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw equal to efforts from Michael Rose and Daryll Meggat when they did get a glimpse of goal. Ayr United manager Ian McCall: \"I think if we win 5-0 we might stay up or go into a play-off, but that's not really the point. \"I thought in the first half we were awful and we looked nervous"}

By the time the shlitz hits the fan, we know each one of the characters, and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities. It's a slow uphill set-up, kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster. Thankfully, once the action kicks in, it's full blown old school HORROR! Steve Johnson's make-up effects are awesome. Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films. And the scares are jolting. Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever, with heart-stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set-ups. The tongue-in-cheek, sometimes cheesy, humor marks this film as pure 80s horror, as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like \"\"Night of the Living Dead\"\" or \"\"Hills Have Eyes.\"\" But for true horror fans, this one is worth checking out.

So I figured from Ebert saying that I would see if it was really as bad as he said it was. I know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but I could not express how much I hated this piece of junk like Ebert did and never since Ebert's review of Rob Reiner's \"\"North\"\" where he said he hated that movie ten times had I ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review. Here we have Richard Dreyfuss as a gangster which I don't think it would be terrible to see Dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well. But above all the other things that were awful about this \"\"movie\"\" I can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all. While the movie starts off with Jeff Goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching Dreyfuss's girlfriend while Dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits.

The stadium's structure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening the field to open up the game.

Showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman 3-4 times in the movie is totally unnecessary. I think one time would have been sufficient. It wouldn't surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other, no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling, unless......Enough about that, let's get into his role.

Today we'll be looking at ways to speed up WordPress development using tools like the WP-CLI, custom shell scripts, and Alfred.This short tutorial was written for OS X, but can be easily adapted for Linux and Windows. It also assumes that you have a basic webserver setup (MAMP or XAMPP will do), and that you have WP-CLI installed. Alfred, a productivity app for OS X, is also featured in this article, but isn't necessary to implement most of the items covered.Let's get started!SetupSetting up a dedicated folder for your development scripts is not only cleaner than adding them to an existing directory such as /usr/local/bin/ , but it also facilitates sharing or syncing your scripts with multiple development environments.To do this, create your custom script folder:mkdir ~/ScriptsThen you'll need to add the folder to your environment PATH by editing your ~/.bash_profile file and adding the following line:export PATH=/Users/$USER/Scripts:$PATHOnce you've saved the ~/.bash_profile , you'll need to restart your Terminal session or run source ~/.bash_profile for the changes to take effect.Finally, create a file called config.sh with the following contents in your ~/Scripts folder:#! /bin/bash"}

This was a completely new; scripted game. Which even had its own theme song! (wouldnt be bond without it, haha!) Gameplay was excellent, and if you're a fan of the bond games or films alike, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />Unlike some/most games, these cast members portrayed their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. Which gives it that more cinematic feel. With a very 'bond'-able storyline, you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie.<br /><br />Enjoyable in all aspects, from start to finish.

Cases involving members of more than one ethnic group were decided by a mixed board consisting of Chinese and Mongols.

But, in order to actually understand this definition, we will have to cover a few concepts first. At the end, we will also illustrate the concepts we learned in the context of StackPHP with some example code. This usually makes things much easier to understand.What is the HttpKernelInterface?--ADVERTISEMENT--The HttpKernelInterface can be defined as more than one thing. At its most basic level, it is a PHP interface found inside the Symfony HttpKernel component. But it is more than that. It is a modern PHP pattern that allows us to treat HTTP requests in an object oriented way instead of dealing with superglobals and output functions like echo or header .But what does this actually mean?The interface provides a single method called handle() that accepts a $request and is expected to return a $response . The latter are basically wrapper objects around the HTTP specification. For example, in Symfony, it is the responsibility of the HttpFoundation component to create and manage these. So as you can imagine, the $request object contains data about the current user request, while the $response object is responsible for"}

Empirical assessments of these impacts are difficult, however, because killer whales are sparsely distributed, highly mobile, and difficult to observe. We present a 4 yr time series of observations of foraging and feeding behavior of >150 transient killer whales that aggregate annually during the northbound migration of gray whales past Unimak Island, Alaska. Most predatory attacks were on gray whale Eschrichtius robustus calves or yearlings and were quickly abandoned if calves were aggressively defended by their mothers.

Despite major efforts to negate Houthi ballistic missile assets through airstrikes, the tempo of ballistic missile activity does not appear to have abated.Interactive MapThis map shows the relative intensity of missile and missile defense-related activity across the Arabian Gulf which has occurred as part of the ongoing Yemen conflict. Beginning in June 2015, the bulk of these incidents have occurred along Yemen-Saudi border around the cities of Najran, Jizan and Abha, but Houthi acquisition of longer-range missiles have more recently permitted attacks as far as Riyadh. Saudi and UAE Patriot missile defenses have intercepted a very high percentage of these launches, greatly limiting damage. Significant activity has also been seen around Al-Mohka and the Straits of Bab-al Mandab, where Houthi-Saleh forces have repeatedly fired antiship cruise missiles at both Emirati and U.S. naval vessels.As of July 10, 2018, there have been 106 publicly reported intercepts of missiles fired from Yemen.Interactive TimelineThis timeline illustrates GCC coalition intercepts of ballistic missiles launched from within Yemen since the operation began.

Benteke missed two chances to level for Palace, floating a woeful spot-kick wide after he was fouled by Angelo Ogbonna and heading against the post moments later. West Ham, who started the game in the bottom three but are now up to 15th, were reduced to 10 men for the last 15 minutes when Cresswell received two bookings within the space of 51 seconds. Hammers keeper Adrian had to make a point-blank save from Connor Wickham's header in injury time, but Alan Pardew's eighth-placed Palace were generally lacking in attack as their five-game unbeaten run in the league came to an end. Media playback is not supported on this device It was a timely result for West Ham boss Slaven Bilic, whose only other league win this season had come against Bournemouth in August. After leading West Ham to a seventh-placed finish last season, Bilic had overseen the Hammers' worst start to a top-flight campaign since 1988-89 in the first seven games this term. But this solid, if not exhilarating, win will ease fears of a relegation battle for a club that has moved into the London Stadium, which currently has a 57,000-capacity. The Croat reshaped his side from the 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough two weeks ago, playing with three centre-backs and bringing left wing-back Cresswell back into the team for the first time this season after a knee injury. And it was Cresswell, who has been touted as a possible England international, who provided the tantalising ball from the left that Lanzini side-footed past Steve Mandanda for his eighth West Ham goal. The Hammers almost finished the game off before Cresswell's dismissal, but Jason Puncheon was on hand to clear Michail Antonio's header off the line. Instead, West Ham had to hold on to their lead with a one-man disadvantage after a harsh sending off for Cresswell. His first booking, moments after the Antonio chance, was given for a dive in the area, although there looked to be some contact from Yohan Cabaye's"}

And eventually you'll be able to talk to them as if they were your mates. \"Could you transfer \u00a3100 to my brother, please?\" you might one day ask your bank. Or maybe, \"Do you have any blue shirts in my size?\" Sometimes they'll ask you things too, with something like: \"Do you want to hear today's top stories?\" Right now the conversations will be structured - with Messenger bots suggesting things you can say. But the goal is natural conversation, and it could be a huge step. If what Facebook has promised today at its F8 developer conference comes to pass, the effect on our everyday lives could be enormous. It could be, according to Facebook's head of messaging David Marcus, a return to more personal interactions. \"Before the internet era, everything was conversational,\" he told the BBC. \"But then we traded conversations for scale.\" One of the bots being launched on the service today will be from Spring, an artificially intelligent concierge service. \"Spring is actually going to build an experience where everything is automated except customer service,\" Mr Marcus explained. \"It's bot for 99.9%, but then if you have a problem, a human can actually jump in and sort out your problem. \"That's the best of both worlds.\" There are obvious concerns to all this, and I'll get to those in a second, but first here's how it will work. Messenger Platform, as Facebook calls it, is the firm's latest application programming interface (API). An API is a way for companies like Facebook to give external developers the access and know-how to make things on their platforms.

If they fail to regain their Scottish heartlands they would have to instead win seats in England that even Tony Blair could not conquer in 1997. The scale of the problem Labour faces in Scotland is demonstrated by a new TNS poll published in the Herald newspaper which suggests 62% of voters intend to vote SNP at next year's Holyrood poll. That would be a huge increase on the 50% who voted SNP in the general election. The Scottish Labour Party got a huge shock when they lost 40 of their 41 Scottish seats in May's general election. But it should not have come as a surprise. They have been in trouble in Scotland for years.

Group profit before tax rose 44.3% to 4.6bn euros (\u00c2\u00a33.9bn), one of the carmaker's highest quarterly results to date. Meanwhile, the group's troubled flagship brand also saw profits surge. Volkswagen brand operating profits rose to 869m euros from 73m euros the year before, although accounting changes meant sales revenues declined 24% to 19bn euros. Investors have said a turnaround at VW's namesake brand, which has had high fixed and research and development costs, is key to turning it into a more appealing business, although VW last year overtook Toyota as the world's biggest selling carmaker. Since the VW diesel emissions scandal broke in 2015, the group has made a number of structural changes. These include streamlining vehicle development, cutting material costs by reducing complexity in parts, dropping unprofitable models and shifting more power to brands and regions to respond more quickly to market needs. \"Our efforts to improve efficiency and productivity across all areas"}

The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />The cinematography really brings out fifty's Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments.

The trial last month of Magdelena Luczak, 27, and Mariusz Krezolek, 34, heard Daniel saw a doctor in hospital for a broken arm, arrived at school with bruises and facial injuries, and was seen scavenging for food.

The petition was started by Paula Barrow, a mother-of-two from Manchester, after hearing about the Pelka case. She said she wanted a new law removing \"uncertainty\" over how professionals should act. Mrs Barrow said after talking to specialist lawyers she wanted to see a system similar to that for corporate manslaughter. \"What they say is that criminal prosecution would not be imposed in all but the most exceptional cases,\" she said. \"It is the preventative effect that is important here.

Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y. pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain "}

A report for the developers suggests some unexploded munitions could remain buried in the former quarry. But it said German nerve gas was removed and destroyed decades ago. The power company Snowdonia Pump Hydro (SPH) want to use the old Glyn Rhonwy quarry as the site of a 600 MWh pumped electricity storage facility. Those proposals are now being considered by the UK's Planning Inspectorate. However, opponents of the scheme in the area have concerns over possible contamination at the Glyn Rhonwy workings. The slate quarry was used as a secret munitions store during WW2, and later it was used to dispose of old and surplus bombs, bullets and grenades. Thousands of tonnes of weapons ended up in quarry pits there, prompting a massive RAF clean-up operation that only ended in the mid-1970s. The 'Concerned about Glyn Rhonwy' group said they believed that chemical weapons may have also been dumped or buried at the site.. A consultant's report confirmed that 70,000 German tabun nerve gas shells seized following WW2 were held at the Llanberis quarry for a short time. They were later moved to another facility near Caernarfon, and eventually dumped at sea.

This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching. But on starting to view it, then I was hooked. In the same way that the Tina Turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life. The acting was superb and even after nearly 20 years after it was made, then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't yet watched it.

It means about a third of babies born today can expect to celebrate their 100th birthday. But are we thinking about the issue in the right way? Ministers have responded to the challenge of the ageing population by increasing the age at which people qualify for the state pension to 68 in future years. This has been done to maintain the ratio of working-age adults to pensioners. At the moment there are 3.7 20 to 64-year-olds for every person over 65. If the current trend in life expectancy continues, by 2050 it will be down to 2 to 1. It will come as no surprise that increasing working lives to 68 almost completely counteracts this. But it is not quite as simple as that. People can only work if they remain in good health - and currently the average \"healthy life expectancy\" is 63.5 years of age, according to the Office for National Statistics. The problem is that a rise in life expectancy does not automatically lead to a similar rise in years spent in reasonable health. Over"}

Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two.

A blog by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial condemned the theft. \"While we do not know who is behind the theft of the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an offensive attack on the memory of the Holocaust,\" it said. Thousands of Jews, foreigners and other groups persecuted by the Nazis were later held at Dachau - initially built to house political prisoners. Many inmates were shot or gassed, with thousands others dying through disease or overwork. The camp is now a memorial, with hundreds of thousand of visitors each year from around the world. "}

Please do keep all that in mind as you read.Vice President Mike Pence is slated to give the commencement address this year at Notre Dame. Typically, the president is asked to speak to the graduating students in the first year of his tenure. The practice seems to have begun with Eisenhower, though it only became consistent after Carter (Clinton seems to have been skipped). Forsaking President Trump was likely a strategic decision; the university didn't want a repeat of the anger directed at former-president Obama's commencement address and ex-VP Biden's receiving the Laetare Medal. Pence, considered the saner and more religious of our executive top dogs, likely presented himself as a safer choice.But is he? The furor over Obama and Biden mostly hinged on their support for abortion and same-sex marriage. The latter, a Catholic, had, in the eyes of many, practically excommunicated himself. All well and good enough: except, of course, that if such is your litmus test for a speaker, Mike Pence is an even worse candidate.Why? Some students have said that his presence will make them feel"}

In an international experiment, a table-tennis coach gave an \"unsporty\" adult an hour's coaching every day for a year in a bid to make him one of the top table tennis players in Britain. Ben Larcombe, a young coach from north London, gave 24-year-old Sam Priestley more than 500 hours of personal tuition and took him to elite training centres in Hungary, Denmark and Middlesbrough. He predicted he could make Sam one of the 250 highest-ranked players in Britain within 12 months. That year has come to an end. \"I became interested in the idea that you can achieve mastery by the quantity and quality of your practice, not innate talent,\" says Ben. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series and how to get in touch To test the theory, he needed someone without experience of table tennis or natural aptitude for the sport. Perhaps unflatteringly, he turned to his childhood friend Sam, a budding entrepreneur who describes himself as an \"unco-ordinated computer geek\". \"I was always one of the worst at any skill-based sport at school,\" says Sam. \"No one would call me sporty.\" In the book Bounce, former Commonwealth table tennis champion Matthew Syed supports the research of K Anders Ericsson which suggested that to become an expert in anything you need to put in an average of 10,000 hours of \"purposeful practice\". There are not 10,000 hours in a year, so Ben focused on the quality of Sam's training. \"If you go to a table tennis club you see lots of people who have played for many, many years, but they are just hitting balls mindlessly and playing matches,\" says Ben. \"Sam and I were always thinking about what we should do with the time we had. Everything we did was focused on Sam's improvement.\" Most lessons were held in the kitchen of Sam's shared flat on a table which also served as a dining table. Ben recorded every session and made a video compilation which shows one second of Sam playing on every day of the challenge. The result is a modern-day Rocky montage in which the streets"}

A potential new tumour treatment called hadron therapy and the \"wonder-material\" graphene also feature. The magazine also picked its top five breakthroughs of the last 25 years. In all, the publication compiled five lists of five to examine different aspects of physics. Graphene has been one of the most talked-about discoveries in the last decade. Its strength, flexibility and conductivity make it a potentially ideal material for bendable smartphones and superior prosthetic limbs. But graphene has another, less-heralded property which could help it transform the everyday lives of people around the world. Despite being just one atom thick, it is impervious to almost all liquids and gases. Generating holes in sheets of graphene could therefore create a selective membrane - \"the ultimate water purifier\" - which might someday create drinking water from the sea. \"Predicting the future is a mug's game. Of course, we expect to get a few of them wrong,\" Hamish Johnston, editor of physicsworld.com told BBC News. \"Grandiose, utopian predictions that never materialise always look faintly ridiculous in years to come - have you seen anyone recently flying to work on a nuclear-powered jet-pack?\" Physics World is the monthly magazine of the Institute of Physics and was first published in October 1988. Selecting the five most important breakthroughs of its lifetime was \"harder than choosing Nobel laureates\", according to reporter Tushna Commissariat. \"There have been so many eye-popping"}

He said it would take more than air power to recapture lost territory in Syria and neighbouring Iraq but a ground force did not need to involve US troops. \"In fact, ideally for the kind of issues we are confronting there, the only truly effective force that will actually be able to reject Isil (IS) from within its own population is a force comprised of Iraqis and Kurds and moderate Syrian opposition,\" he said.

Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements.

Wouldn't it be a nice feature if Rust had some syntaxic sugar to mimic this ?Composition and inheritanceWhen I have:// java-like language interface Foo { void doSomething(); } class Bar : Foo { void doSomething() { ... } }The nice thing is that in class Baz : Bar {} method doSomething() is implicitely available as a method of Baz. A well known limitation of this pattern and one of the main arguments for the composition over inheritance principle is that it cannot be extended to import methods from different classes (unless of course your language offers multiple inheritance). That's why the compositional equivalent is often presented as a better practice:class Baz : Foo { Bar bar; void doSomething() { this.bar.doSomething(); } }Rust has no type inheritance (not yet?) but composition can of course be used in a similar manner:trait Foo { fn do_something(&self); } impl Foo for Bar { fn do_something(&self) { ... } } struct Baz { ... bar : Bar } impl Foo for Baz { fn do_something(&self) { bar.do_something(); } }Now the main drawback for this pattern in Rust and in most OO languages is the boilerplate implied.

Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties of fossilization, the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time."}

Senegal's President Macky Sall, who currently heads the West African regional group Ecowas, told journalists on the sidelines of the summit that the money pledged was \"not enough for the whole of Africa\". Later, at the closing press conference, he said he was pleased with the trust fund, but said he would like to see it \"more generously financed\". Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou echoed the Senegalese president's sentiments and added that \"reform of global governance\" was also needed, to make world trade fairer, Reuters news agency reports. While Somalia's Prime Minister Omar Abdirashidali Sharmatke told the BBC:  \"What Africa needs today is not charity, but investment.\" EU Council President Donald Tusk said the summit had agreed \"a long list of very concrete actions to be implemented by the end of 2016\".

(Wikipedia)So let's figure out what we mean by P and NP.P problems are easily solved by computers, and NP problems are not easily solvable, but if you present a potential solution it's easy to verify whether it's correct or not.As you can see from the diagram above, all P problems are NP problems. That is, if it's easy for the computer to solve, it's easy to verify the solution. So the P vs NP problem is just asking if these two problem types are the same, or if they are different, i.e. that there are some problems that are easily verified but not easily solved.It currently appears that P \u2260 NP, meaning we have plenty of examples of problems that we can quickly verify potential answers to, but that we can't solve quickly.

Official plans to end net neutrality and let firms run fast and slow lanes for data have generated wide debate in the US. More than three million comments about the proposed change were lodged with the US regulator overseeing the debate. However, the president's intervention has been criticised by internet service providers and some Republican politicians. \"Net neutrality is Obamacare for the internet,\" said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is aligned with the conservative Tea Party wing of the Republicans. \"It puts the government in charge of determining internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered.\" \"We cannot allow internet service providers to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas,\" said President Obama in a video statement on the issue. He said net neutrality had been built into the \"fabric\" of the net since its creation and had been essential to its growth and continuing influence. He called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \"answer the call\" heard in the millions of comments left on its website in support of net neutrality and implement \"the strongest possible rules\" to protect the principle. Net neutrality revolves around the idea that ISPs should not be allowed to manipulate the data flowing to their customers. The FCC is considering changing rules governing data traffic, following a court ruling in January that allowed ISP Verizon to charge to carry traffic from bandwidth-heavy services such as Netflix. Net neutrality advocates have called on the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as \"Title Two telecommunications services\" rather than their current status as \"information services\". They "}

He asked Cpl Edwards what he thought about claims from higher ranking Army personnel that physical drills were not being used as punishment at the time. \"I would say certain people within that area are lying,\" he replied. Mr Large said: \"Are you able to recall"}

He said earlier this year: \"Music has been Britain's strongest cultural export of the last 50 years and we intend to produce an Olympic closing ceremony that will be a unique promotion of great British popular music.\" Gavin's creative team includes designer Es Devlin, music director David Arnold and lighting director Patrick Woodroffe, alongside executive producer Stephen Daldry.

Conservatives in Wirral South, UKIP candidate Phil Eckersley and sitting Labour MPs like Peter Kyle, Maria Eagle and Rachel Reeves are among those turning to the technique. There is nothing new about politicians raising money online - but the snap election has left them very little time to raise money through traditional methods, forcing them to get creative. Lib Dem Stephen Lloyd, who is trying to regain the Eastbourne seat he lost to Conservative Caroline Ansell in 2015, said: \"Where you have more time, I have fundraising dinners, I've gone to more quizzes and raffles and tombolas than you could shake a stick at. \"I instantly realised I didn't have time to do ten fundraisers over the next month.\" The internet offered an answer. He set up a page on his website asking for donations, and shared it on Facebook. Within a week, 551 donors had raised over \u00a316,000.

He was, after all, the Heart of England NHS Trust's busiest surgeon, taking on the lion's share of operations in his department, as well as running busy private clinics in the West Midlands.

She had recently lost her mother and sister to breast cancer, and the surgeon told her to have double mastectomy or risk \"full-blown cancer\". In the end, she opted to have one breast, her left, removed, and underwent eight other operations at Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull after Paterson said he kept finding \"sinister\" looking lumps.

The end of the drama came on Thursday afternoon in the Rose Garden: Mr Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the accord. He said that his decision marked \"a resurgence of American sovereignty\", and people in the front row cheered.

In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production.

The act authorized three gold coins: $10.00 eagles, $5.00 half eagles, and $2.50 quarter eagles, in addition to silver coins.Of course, later US political leaders have largely committed the Constitution to the dustbin.

He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable.

Back pain is a leading cause of disability and in the UK alone it is estimated to affect 26 million people each year. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which establishes best NHS practice, currently recommends paracetamol for both lower back pain and for osteoarthritis. However, questions have been raised about the quality of the evidence which led to the decisions. A team at the University of Sydney assessed data from 13 drug trials involving more than 5,000 patients. They concluded that paracetamol was \"ineffective\" at reducing back pain. In osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, they found a small improvement with paracetamol. Yet the impact was so small it was \"not clinically important\".

It is considered a better indicator of perfusion to vital organs than systolic blood pressure (SBP). True MAP can only be determined by invasive monitoring and complex calculations; however it can also be calculated using a formula of the SBP and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP).To calculate a mean arterial pressure, double the diastolic blood pressure and add the sum to the systolic blood pressure. Then divide by 3. For example, if a patient's blood pressure is 83 mm Hg/50 mm Hg, his MAP would be 61 mm Hg.

It's decades since I read it, and one of the things I'd forgotten is how rounded a character Darcy is. In my mind, fed by at least three different television adaptations over the years, his early appearances are characterised by his unforgivable snobbishness, and dismissiveness of almost everything and everyone he encounters. In fact, it's much more complicated than that. And more interesting.Everybody \u2013 including me \u2013 thinks they know the arc of the storyline. It's as well-known, and as straightforward, as Romeo and Juliet, with mutual dislike replacing love at first sight. Wrong. There is dislike but, following a single disastrous evening, it is all on Elizabeth's side. She is the one whose pride is piqued, so that despite several days spent in the same house as Darcy \u2013 tell you later \u2013 she sees only hauteur and self-importance while Austen makes sure that the reader is seeing something quite different. She does this by telling us exactly what is going through Darcy's mind at crucial moments. I was astonished to realise that she makes it absolutely clear what is going on as early as Chapter 6. By their second meeting, following the famously awful first encounter in Chapter 4, he is finding her face 'rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes' and other discoveries 'equally mortifying' concerning her figure and easy manner.Meanwhile,"}

Once he's happy with the features and all, he'll make sure it finds its way to the core.

Others were left to do that. Nevertheless, Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg made it clear they were not lacking for performance. \"I'm paying attention, of course,\" said Rosberg, who described the car as \"quick\". \"We have strategists and they're doing calculations already, so more or less we already know where we are, with a band of errors. \"Would you like to know?

Prime Minister David Cameron called it the \"biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian era\". During a visit to Birmingham to announce the railway investment,  the PM said it would lead to the electrification of an extra 850 miles of track. He said: \"This investment will mean faster journeys, more seats, better access to stations, greater freight links and a truly world-class rail network.\" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who joined the PM on the visit, said the plans would help \"close the north south divide\". It includes \u00a35.2bn for the completion of current schemes, such as Crossrail and Thameslink and \u00a34.2bn for new projects. These include: Building work on the rail projects will not start until at least 2014, as the announcement covers the period 2014 to 2019. The government said it would be funded \"in part from fare rises already announced in 2010 and also from the substantial efficiency savings which projects like electrification will have on the long-term operating costs of the railways\". In January this year, passengers faced average increases of RPI inflation plus 1% on regulated fares, which are set to rise by RPI plus 3% in January 2013 and 14. Transport Secretary Justine Greening told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had a long-term plan to make the rail industry work more efficiently and stop the above-inflation fare rises. \"We've got to get the money from somewhere so, for the time being, the passengers are paying,\" she said. \"We all know that diesel is massively expensive so if we can move over to electric trains, not only are they greener, they're also cheaper"}

This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station.

The result is the multiple expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger"}

Police say they both suffered \"violent and deliberate\" deaths. Police from the two states are now working together on their suspected murder investigations into how and where the two died. On Wednesday, the identification of the remains via DNA tests and blood samples was described as a major breakthrough by detectives involved in the investigations. \"This is one of the most shocking crimes imaginable; one that has not only devastated a family, but also had a terrible impact on the wider community,\" South Australia Detective Superintendent Des Bray said. He appealed for assistance from the public, saying that \"those responsible for these horrific crimes remain amongst us in the community, and they must quickly be caught and held to account for their actions\". Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson's remains were found at Belango State Forest. She was initially named \"Angel\" because of a T-shirt she was found with."}

Consideration has been weighted to reflect how often a particular uniform combination is worn. The Cowboys, for example, hardly ever wear their blue jersey, so that design doesn't count very much in the team's ranking.\u2022 Certain rankings "}

The special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did I feel like I was watching a video game. There, that is the last nice thing I have to say about this film. In fact, I would just like everyone reading this to take note that I can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. <br /><br />I have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. My first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the \"\"plot twist\"\" (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where Lois's 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of Superman. When the crying super-child throws a piano at Lex's henchman to save his mother, I almost got up and left the theater. Singer could have made a much better Superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. It's been 5 days since I saw the movie and I still want to vomit. <br /><br />My next major complaint has to do with the fact that Superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. It doesn't take comic book guy from the Simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. I don't know how many comic books Brian Singer has read, but when Superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. Whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any Superman-related projects ever again. The"}

In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors.

It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: This film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father. There is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard. This leans towards the Gothic feel. I would love to see this as a full feature film. -- Carrie"}

Still, this is a positive discussion and a sign that -- one day -- teams might not be as constricted as they are now. Let's run through them individually while we have a moment:Expanded game rosters: At the moment, teams must deactivate seven of their 53 players on game day. That 46-man limit created problems on a number of occasions last season, notably as it related to depth in games on short rest. So the Washington Redskins have proposed allowing 49 active players for games not scheduled on Sunday or Monday (i.e., Thursday). The purpose of game-day deactivations is to give opposing teams an equal number of available players -- typically each has a different number of moderate injuries that require a week off but not a trip to injured reserve -- but 46 cuts it pretty tight. I would love to see 49 for all games, as would most coaches, but making the adjustment for Thursday night games would be a good start.Bigger practice squads: Last season, as we discussed at the time, the NFL seemed to "}

Gabrielsson visited the Californian company Glasspar to talk about a new sports car. Glasspar was a company which made glass-fibre bodies for boats and cars, like the Chevrolet Corvette (the most popular car of the USA which has a glass-fibre body). Gabrielsson told Glasspar to develop a new sports car on a PV444-chassis, running gear and the new B14B 70bhp engine. The design drawings (Gabrielsson thought Volvo needed a sports car to boost up the sales of the PV) were actually completed before Gabriellson left the USA.Bill Tritt (Glasspar) working on a clay scale model of the car that would become the Volvo P1900At the end of 1953 Glasspar finished two protoypes (designed by Bill Tritt): a convertible and a coup\u00e9. The car was called: Volvo P1900, also known as Volvo Sport.

And some experts say men wanting to conceive need to be selective about the sport they do as some types may harm sperm. Too much time riding a bike or doing long-distance running in tight clothing may not be good, other studies suggest. Similarly, wearing tight underwear rather than boxer shorts has been linked with lower sperm levels. In the latest study, the researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health asked 189 young men who were students at a university in New York to record how many hours they had been spending doing physical activity and watching TV in a typical week. The volunteers, all aged between 18 and 22, were also asked to provide a sperm sample for lab analysis. When the researchers compared the survey findings with the sperm test results they found the link between sedentary lifestyle and low sperm count.

I oppose renewing Trident. Tony Blair took Britain to war in Iraq on a false prospectus. I oppose British airstrikes over Syria. British politics is changing. My election was a political earthquake. I am popular and authentic. The mainstream media don't get it. Social media is the future. Labour Party members will now have the final say over policy - NB my Cabinet in the Shadows. Grown-up politics allows for disagreement. I won't be rude to people. So, my fellow Corbynistas, don't you be rude either, particularly online. I will oppose Tory plans to update the electoral register so Labour doesn't lose student votes. I will oppose cuts to tax credits. I am a patriot. I share the same values as the British people. I love my country. I like the NHS and the BBC. I don't like profit. Self-employed workers should have statutory maternity and paternity pay. The railways should be nationalised. I want to build more council houses and spend more on mental health. You don't have to accept your place in a world shaped by globalisation and competitive markets.

The lot of France's 240,000 police and gendarmes is certainly not a happy one. Since jihadist terror struck Paris in November they have been on extra duties for the post-attacks state of emergency. Holidays were cancelled, unpaid overtime is accumulating. Add to that the migrant camps near Calais, which have required several companies of riot police. Plus: And then on Monday came the shocking news of two officers murdered by an Islamist in Magnanville, west of Paris. It is small wonder that many officers feel they are at the end of their tether. President Francois Hollande recognises the strains. At Friday's ceremony in Versailles for the murdered police couple, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing and Jessica Schneider, he paid tribute to the dedication of the service. And he said he would meet some of the demands of police unions to ensure their better protection. For example, even after the state of emergency runs out next month, officers will continue to be allowed to carry handguns when off duty.  And there will be extra, so far unspecified, measures to safeguard police anonymity. The greatest fear after Monday's murders is that lone-wolf Islamists will target police officers whom they have come up against personally in the past as petty criminals. \"We've all at one time or another had contracts put on our heads by robbers or gang-leaders,\" says Olivier Berton of the Alliance union. \"Regularly they send out juniors to check out the cars parked outside the police station, to get the registration numbers.\" Officers are now under standing instructions not to wear uniform when off duty, not"}

Note that this is not a quality rating: it's based on my memory of landmarks, references, and other \"easter eggs\" that would make any Yinzer smile knowingly.Of course, being an analytical person armed with a new data set, I wondered how my PGH scores did correlate with film quality.

A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \"distributive efficiency\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher."}

The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mean \"thanks\". Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them.

The results of the new research by Ceiridwen Edwards and Ross Barnett have been published in the Royal Society journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Among Dr Edwards' previous work was an attempt to carry out DNA analysis of a sample taken from bones of a polar bear washed into caves in north west Scotland 18,000 years ago.

Prof Sykes, along with other genetics experts, conducted DNA tests on hairs from two unidentified animals, one from Ladakh - in northern India on the west of the Himalayas - and the other from Bhutan, 800 miles (1,285km) further east. The results were then compared with the genomes of other animals stored on a database of all published DNA sequences. The scientists found that he had a 100% match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago - a time when the polar bear and closely-related brown bear were separating as different species.

The announcement coincided with the final day of the CES tech show in Las Vegas, where other new mobile phones and gadgets have been launched. Nokia no longer manufactures phones that carry its name but has instead licensed its brand to another Finnish company, HMD Global. Until now, the only phones that had been released under the deal had been more basic \"feature phone\" models. The Android device had been highly anticipated and marks Nokia's return to the smartphone market after a series of Windows Phone models. Microsoft briefly used the brand for about a year after buying Nokia's mobile devices unit in 2014. Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system. HMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017. It is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February. \"The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,\" the firm said in a statement. \"With over 552 million smartphone users in China in "}

Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story.

It lies above the Bering Land Bridge (BLB), also called Beringia (sometimes misspelled Beringea), a submerged landmass that once connected the Siberian mainland with North America. While Beringia's shape and size while above water is variously described in publications, most scholars would agree the land mass included the Seward Peninsula, as well as existing land areas of northeast Siberia and western Alaska, between the Verkhoyansk Range in Siberia and the Mackenzie River in Alaska. As a waterway, the Bering Strait connects the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean over the polar ice cap, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean.The climate of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) when it was above sea level during the Pleistocene was long thought to have been primarily a herbaceous tundra or steppe-tundra. However, recent pollen studies have shown that during the Last Glacial Maximum (say, between 30,000-18,000 calendar years ago, abbreviated as cal BP), the environment was a mosaic of diverse but cold plant and animal habitats.Living on the Bering Land BridgeWhether Beringia was habitable or not at a given time is determined by the sea level and presence of surrounding ice: specifically, whenever the sea level drops about 50 meters (~164 feet) below its present position, the land surfaces.

These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects."}

The story is canon within the Star Wars universe.\"When Motive started to work on this campaign, it was at the time when The Force Awakens was still in theaters,\" said Motive's game director Mark Thompson during the reveal panel. \"We were all super excited about that because that leaves so many amazing questions. [\u2026] So we thought, 'Hey, let's try and tell one of those stories that connects these two amazing trilogies together.' \"As a twist on what we normally see in Star Wars, Iden is allied with the Empire and not the Rebellion.

Mr Yuan already has some experience of British football, as he is a former youth coach at Championship club Newcastle United, and also studied and played in the UK. \"I am interested in how English clubs commercialise the assets at their clubs, to learn ways about running our football centre in Beijing more effectively commercially. \"I am also interested in learning about player rehabilitation, as I see an opportunity to introduce a rehabilitation facility into our centre,\" he says.

At the approach of its centennial, Saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland. The twelve \"\"impressions\"\" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings, allowing the power of each performance to explode before Saura's camera. Creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song, dance and instrumental performance. Photographs of Albeniz reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of the music to its great creator. Saura encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.\""}

But how bad is it, exactly? Here are some reasons why it could be a grievous wound - or nothing but a scratch. Explanations dismantled. Mrs Clinton had a carefully constructed series of justifications and defences for her email decisions while secretary of state. James Comey's unusual press conference exploded like a torpedo beneath the water line, sinking those efforts. Mrs Clinton said she hadn't sent classified information. The FBI found more than 100 of her 30,000 emails (0.3%) contained details that were classified \"at the time\" they were transmitted and \"a very small number\" had markings \"indicating the presence of classified information\". She also said she had turned over all her work-related messages, but in fact her lawyers relied on keyword searches to sort through the email files and consequently missed several thousand relevant documents. Major media fact-checkers were quick to survey the scope of the damage. Politifact said the FBI \"clearly undercuts Clinton's defence\". The Washington Post upgraded its verdict on the veracity of Mrs Clinton's classified information claims from two to four \"Pinocchios\". The Associated Press wrote that the FBI \"left much of her account in tatters and may have aggravated questions of trust swirling around her Democratic presidential candidacy\". Polls show that many voters give Mrs Clinton low marks for veracity and openness - and these latest revelations will do nothing to help change this view. It's a lead weight holding her overall approval ratings down when she needs to be generating enthusiasm and energy for her general election campaign. Strength undermined. The Clinton team has framed much of its campaign as a contrast with Donald Trump, whom they are painting as a reckless and dangerous commander-in-chief. The former secretary of state, they counter, is tested and competent - a steady hand on the wheel in troubled times. But are steady hands labelled \"extremely careless\" with classified information by the FBI? Do they leave their personal communications open to possible \"hostile actors\", including sending emails on an unclassified system while \"in the territory of sophisticated adversaries\"? On Tuesday afternoon the Trump campaign sent a press release leading with the charge that Mrs Clinton \"compromised the safety of the American people\". \"Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton,\" he wrote, \"and that fact alone disqualifies her from service\". While there's no tangible support for that particular piece of Trump bluster, if the public doesn't buy Mrs Clinton's argument that she's the \"safe\" choice, much of the advantage she has on her sometimes intemperate opponent will disappear.

The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number. Thus a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end-user by a transport layer protocol, although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service."}

The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurricane Dora in 1964, the only recorded storm to hit the First Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barely diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. Jacksonville also suffered damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was inundated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area. These tropical cyclones were the costliest indirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 "}

Microsoft, Samsung, ARM and several other organisations that teach coding to youngsters are also involved. The roll-out is happening later in the school year than originally planned. But there is undoubtedly pent-up enthusiasm for the computer. Unlike other budget computers - such as the Raspberry Pi - the machine is meant to be programmed via the web, rather than being connected to a keyboard and screen of its own. So, what can it do? As a standalone device it can be made to flash its LEDs in sequence and take readings from several built-in sensors, but when added to other hardware the possibilities are limitless. Below are seven projects by some of those who got their hands on the tech early. Read more: The Vamps help launch the Micro Bit Can the Micro Bit inspire a million? Microsoft chief checks out the Micro Bit What is the Micro Bit? The initial batch of Micro Bits were very limited in number. But that didn't stop one school launching their copy more than 32km (20 miles) into the air. One of the pupils at Rishworth School in West Yorkshire wrote a program that used a heat sensor to log changes in temperature and show the current reading on the computer's LEDs. Her classmates then attached the kit to a helium balloon and let it fly upwards. \"Her code measured the temperature in the stratosphere, which is pretty awesome,\" recalled the teacher in charge, Peter Bell. \"The kids were absolutely buzzing about the whole project.\" But he added that anyone thinking of repeating the initiative should not do so lightly. \"We had to get civil aviation authority approval and were given a two-hour window to launch,\" he explained. \"And on its descent, it initially fell for 14 seconds travelling at up to 180mph [290km/h]. \"At one point National Air Traffic Services apparently rerouted all the aircraft around Nottingham because there was essentially a missile travelling towards the airspace, but the parachute deployed when it got to an atmosphere where enough air was hitting it.\" The equipment was later recovered from a farmer's field.

As noted in his initial recruitment report, Logan Cudgelurdge was born physically weak and very clumsy. Through his current training, he is no longer weak, and is indeed tough and slow to tire, there is still much improvement to be made in order to shape Logan into the perfect super-soldier.About two months ago I called together the great minds of the fortress, setting up a meeting in the library to brainstorm ways to effectively raise Logan's physical and mental conditioning. One scholar brought to my attention that Swimming increases all combat-related attributes except toughness. He advocated a design involving minecarts to simulate the movement of a dwarf while swimming, speeding up the learning process exponentially."}

Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince, but he died before Kublai in 1285. Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother K\u00f6kejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Tem\u00fcr Khan, or Emperor Chengzong, from 1294 to 1307.

This manga diverges quite a bit from this \"expected\" storyline by making the relationship between misaki and kuroe a main part of this chronicle.As you continue to read this manga,you would probably be reminded a lot of the anime called Kure-nai (for those who have seen it) in which a young girl has feelings for her guardian who is significantly older. Kuroe so far only thinks of Misaki as a child and wants to protect her from the dangers of vampires with malicious intent.Another enjoyable part of this story is that as a viewer you would \"sometimes\" get to see the thoughts of Misaki and her feelings for Kuroe, which are further implied through her actions.

It was the wicket of Misbah, bowled by James Anderson, that began the England recovery, one desperately needed after Pakistan had dominated day two to begin Friday on 257-3. There was a wobble when Anderson was ordered from the attack controversially, an umpiring decision that helped Sarfraz Ahmed (46 not out) shepherd the tail to add 32 for the final two wickets.

He will spell out why he believes the personal allowance should be raised in a broadcast interview on Monday night and in newspaper articles. A Lib Dem party election broadcast will also be devoted to the subject on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Balls has asserted that tax cuts are now the best short-term route to stimulating demand in the economy, moving away from his previous emphasis on extra Whitehall spending, a position that wins little support among those worried by the existing deficit.Even unfunded tax cuts win more support from voters than extra government spending, though the impact on borrowing is the same.Balls insisted his preference was still for tax cuts built round a temporary"}

She doesn't have the skills or the training to handle a complicated pregnancy. Still, she gets on with what she knows best: pushing and pulling with her hands, as if trying to rearrange the insides of the young woman. The pain becomes so severe, the woman, Razia Shamshad, loses consciousness. Her ordeal drags on for about four days, at the end of which the dai manages to pull out the remains of what would have been a baby girl. As if the trauma of losing her first child isn't enough, Razia is also left with chronic incontinence. But the dai tells her not to worry, saying \"it's all going to be fine in due course\". Instead, Razia's condition worsens as she starts leaking faeces and urine from her vagina. What she doesn't know is that her long and fruitless labour has caused obstetric fistula - preventable and treatable, but not if you live where she does. \"My clothes were constantly wet and filthy below the waist. I would smell all the time. I felt helpless,\" she says. \"Some neighbours and relatives despised me. Others made fun of me. They said I must have done something to deserve this.\" But Razia's only fault, it would seem, was that she was born into a poor family and with a genetic sight disorder. As a visually impaired girl, in a country which prizes boys, she was never sent to school, even though she was smart enough to memorise the Koran at an early age. When she became a teenager, Razia was married to a man she did not really know. But she soon became a young widow when her husband died in a road accident.

Members of Israel's Ethiopian community, who account for about 130,000 of the country's eight million population, called for the commissioner to be sacked. Last year, thousands took to the streets to protest against alleged police abuses after a video emerged showing two officers beating an Ethiopian-Israeli soldier. At a meeting of the Israel Bar Association in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Mr Alsheich was asked why Ethiopian-Israelis appeared to be singled out by his force. \"Studies the world over, without exception, have shown that immigrants are invariably more involved in crime than others, and this should not come as a surprise,\" he responded. Research had also shown that young people in general were more involved in crime and that \"when the two come together, there's a situation in which a given community is more involved than others in crime, statistically speaking\", he added. The commissioner said this had been the case \"in all the waves of immigration\" to Israel, and \"also with regard to [Israeli] Arabs or [Palestinians in] East Jerusalem\". \"When a police officer comes across a suspicious person, his brain suspects him more than if he were someone else.

Wildcats are not known to have been previously recorded in the location where the photographs were taken. Meanwhile, the project's camera traps in Strathbogie in Aberdeenshire have photographed unidentified cats. Scottish Wildcat Action has begun what has been described as the largest ever survey for Scottish wildcats. The 60-day effort involves more than 300 cameras and more than 130 volunteers. It focuses on five of Scottish Wildcat Action's six priority areas - Strathpeffer, Strathbogie, Strathavon, North Strathspey and the Angus Glens.

The plot is lacking something that I can't put my finger on... it just seems a little \"\"fluffy.\"\" But if you love sci-fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells though might happened in the next hundred years, this is a must see. It's worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing: a long, drawn-out war, because they were just about to go to war with Germany, and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything.<br /><br />Things to Come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once.\""}

It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters.

As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and "}

Activists have begun legal proceedings. It caused an uproar after a local paper said it had served as cover for officials to embezzle public funds. The report did not find any evidence of wrongdoing by any officials. Areva says it cannot comment on the report. The French company says it has not yet received the report. It has previously said it was co-operating with a French investigation into the case. Niger is one of the world's biggest uranium producers and the metal is the country's largest export. Opposition parties say the report has been botched and lacks integrity. They say that two of their lawmakers who were part of the group which led the inquiry were not associated in drafting the document. Last month, activists in Niger started legal action into the deal, saying they feared the parliamentary investigation would lead to a whitewash. Their complaint alleges embezzlement of public funds, money laundering, forgery and conspiracy to defraud. According to the parliamentary inquiry: \"A transaction took place indeed between Sopamin [a local mining company], Areva and other international partners.\" \"The uranium used in that transaction is not uranium from Niger. The money transferred to [a bank account] in Dubai to fund the transaction is neither money of the state of Niger nor of Sopamin - it is Areva's "}

In the UK, 5.2 million homes are in flood risk zones but only 1.7 million of these have had flood prevention measures installed. The lack of action is partly the result of people being unaware that they live in a flood risk zone. It is also because householders do not believe it could happen to them. But, during last winter, it did for thousands of people, including Mr and Mrs Brice. They had to wait four months before the house was certified as dry enough for works to begin. So far only four of the property's 11 rooms have been renovated. While their insurance company has covered the cost of restoring their home, the Brices have invested in specialist flood proofing materials. They have to pick up the bill for these additions themselves. \"All these measures should mean that if there is a flood again it will be a clean up operation not a total evacuation and rebuild,\" says Mrs Brice. The partition walls have all been rebuilt with flood resistant insulation - fibre glass absorbs flood water and must be replaced if it gets wet. In addition, the beams are water treated and the plaster board being used is a specialist anti-flood form of gypsum. All the floors are now marine ply with an Amtico covering. Beyond using anti-flood, mould resistant materials, the Brices decided to increase the floor heights of their home as well. \"We've lifted our floors by nearly 25cm,\" says Mrs Brice. \"It means we have had to lift the heights of all our windows and doors as well but it gives us peace of mind. \"The windows have cost \u00a34,000 to fix.

Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle inside host cells, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L)."}

And two years earlier, Kenneth Cole, boss of the eponymous clothing and accessories brand, tweeted this howler during the Egyptian revolution: \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now online...\" The twitterstorm that followed forced him to make a swift apology in which he admitted that his tweet had been \"insensitive\" and \"absolutely inappropriate\". So perhaps it is no wonder only 10% of the chief executives running the world's 50 largest companies regularly tweet, according to a survey by marketing consultancy Weber Shandwick. The risk of contracting foot-in-mouth disease seems just too high for many. But Robert Glaesener, boss of Twitter analytics firm Talkwalker, believes the fact that most of them are aged 50-to-60 has more to do with it - they're simply too old to understand social media fully, he says. Even tweeting extrovert Sir Richard Branson, who has more than six million followers and epitomises the consumer-friendly, approachable boss, is prone to the occasional gaffe. His tweet on the day of the fatal Virgin Galactic crash last year began: \"Space is hard - but worth it.\" This was considered insensitive by some commentators and led others to question the legitimacy of his space tourism mission. \"There is a real danger that something that is well meant can end up creating cynicism on social media,\" warns Mr Glaesener. \"While most of the responses to that tweet were positive and supportive, there were also negative responses with people questioning his motives.\" But leaving Twitter campaigns to your corporate PR team sometimes isn't any better. When British Gas decided to hold a Twitter Q&A with customers on the same day it announced price rises of 9.2%, it led to a barrage of abuse hurled at the then customer services director, Bert Pijls.

Hull's 28-0 half-time lead was extended when Michaels spectacularly completed his treble, while Jansin Turgut, Jordan Thompson, Jake Connor and two from Jamie Shaul wrapped up the victory. Catalans had no answer to Hull, who beat Warrington in last year's final to lift the trophy for the first time. Hull opened the scoring with a free-flowing move which was finished off by Michaels in the left-hand corner, while Shaul and Mark Minichiello combined to set up Griffin. Fonua went over in the corner, Watts spotted a gap in the Catalans defence to run to the side of the posts and Michaels took Turgut's pass to score his second try. Great work from Watts and Albert Kelly freed Taylor as Hull romped to a 28-point lead at the break. Michael's dived over acrobatically in the corner for his third try and Turgut collected a short pass to grab his second try in Hull colours.

Many of them went to the United States. These emigrants included land-hungry peasants and workers from rural backgrounds, as well as artisans and shopkeepers hoping to make a new start. Between 1874 and 1879 emigration decreased somewhat, but after 1880 economic fluctuations fuelled the next and largest wave of emigration, which only began to subside in the mid-1890s. This report by a British Royal Commission analyzes the causes and effects of German emigration. It highlights low wages, a lack of employment opportunities, and the decline of older industries as economic reasons for emigration, but political considerations \u2013 e.g., the attitude of the German government towards the Social Democratic movement \u2013 also played an important role. The attractiveness of the U.S. was enhanced when Germans contemplating emigration received upbeat letters or money transfers (remittances) from friends and relatives who were already there. Enticing advertisements by steamship companies only added to the allure. Like later advocates of German colonization, however, the authors of this report recognize that emigration also drained Germany of productive forces and potential military recruits. print version return to document list previous document next document page 1 of 2Some indications have already been given"}

The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second"}

There's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies!

The war devastated the Cardassian state and greatly contributed to its eventual absorption into the Dominion, thus achieving what the Klingon invasion had claimed to prevent. The manipulation of the Klingons into launching an unprovoked attack on the Cardassians would prove to be one of the greatest coups of Changeling infiltration in the Alpha Quadrant.Contents show]Revolution and paranoia EditIn 2372, reports emerged through the sealed borders of the Cardassian Union that the Cardassian Central Command had been overthrown by a popular uprising, restoring power to the civilian Detapa Council. The growing strength of the Cardassian dissident movement, coupled with the loss of security due to the collapse of the Obsidian Order following the disastrous Battle of the Omarion Nebula, had at last been able to remove one of the most oppressive regimes in the Alpha Quadrant.On Qo'noS, the news was received in a different light.

Granata and his partner, Jennifer Peaston, had met the backpacker at a party in November 2012 and invited her to their hotel room. The backpacker was forced to live in the shower. Granata, with the help of Peaston, beat the woman with various objects including a meat tenderiser and rolling pin, and performed bizarre rituals on her. The judge said the woman was left a \"reclusive and frightened\" individual. Earlier this year, a judge found that Peaston was traumatised and had also been a victim of abuse by Granata.

You can watch our review of the gadget year. I've also been looking back at this blog and the stories I have covered in 2013. So here are some highlights: January It has been a year in which Samsung and Apple continued to make huge piles of cash from smartphones - and the rest scrapped for third place. There was no radical innovation in phones this year - although screens got ever bigger and 4G became standard. With lots of new brands, notably from China, making very decent smartphones at a low price, it was a good year for consumers. But for the likes of Nokia, HTC and Blackberry, making a profit in this market got ever tougher. Samsung, Apple, Nokia - and the smartphone dogfight February In the UK, impatience over the slow progress of the government's rural broadband programme has mounted. Some communities decided they had better do it themselves and projects like B4RN, where farmers laid fibre optic cables across fields in Lancashire and Cumbria, showed what was possible. Fast fibre - a community shows the way March The idea that Britain's schoolchildren need a better grounding in how computers work really took hold this year, with the cheap Raspberry Pi computer project providing an opening for many schools.  This post about a schools competition showed just how inventive children can be with computers when they are given the right tools. The Life of Pi- clever ideas from a tiny computer April At the beginning of the year who'd heard of Bitcoin apart from a few libertarian enthusiasts? By April, though, the crypto-currency had soared in value, climbing from above $200 (\u00a3121) after starting 2013 at below $10 (\u00a36). As wave after wave of media interest propelled it higher - it topped $1200 (\u00a3730) in early December - the Bitcoin believers proclaimed it the future of money.  The sceptics talked of the Dutch tulip mania, and asked whether Bitcoin could be called a currency when you could not use it "}

The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there's a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. We're literally catapulted back to the 1930's, with a sublime depiction of that era's music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shelley Winters) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies.

Nationalists at Belfast City Council had wanted the union flag taken down altogether, but in the end voted on a compromise from the Alliance Party that it would fly on designated days. Unionists said they considered the changes to be an attack on their cultural identity. A loyalist protest outside the building erupted into violence minutes after the motion was passed. Disorder also broke out in east Belfast. Fifteen police officers were injured, as well as a press photographer and two security guards. Police were criticised by Sinn F\u00e9in for not anticipating the violence. Council staff removed the flag at 07:00 GMT on Tuesday. It is now only flown on 18 designated days. Parades and flags are important symbols to loyalists, who describe them as expressions of their culture.

His belief is that making work a more pleasant place to be, by offering more flexibility; such as the ability to dress down, work from home or part-time, and take unpaid leave if they wish, will attract people and encourage them to stay and fulfil their potential. \"Hopefully that'll be the world of the future and that's something that we're working towards trying to get more flexibility in the workforce generally,\" he says.

In the electron microprobe, individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals.

But when the idea of allowing students to use search engines in exams was suggested recently, the immediate fear was \"dumbing down\". Only a few years ago, there was a similar debate about the use of calculators. For the 11-year-olds sitting their national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, in England this week, the emphasis is on mental arithmetic. Calculators are no longer permitted. Their use will also be limited in the new GCSE maths exams, for which students will start studying this autumn. Dictionaries have had a similarly chequered track record in foreign language exams. They were banned 15 years ago, after research suggested they gave the brightest students a greater advantage. Newly redrafted GCSEs in French, Spanish and German will be introduced in 2016. As part of its recent consultation on the exam, the regulator Ofqual has asked about the ban on dictionaries. In the responses, opinion was divided, suggesting this is not a settled debate. In different ways, these are all dilemmas about the boundary between knowledge and understanding, between retrieving information and manipulating it. And with search engines, it is very much a digital conundrum. Imagine for a moment the pre-digital equivalent - allowing students to roam through a vast library. They simply would not have time to find the references they needed and return to their desk to complete the exam. Now unimaginable amounts of information lie at our fingertips. But does the act of memorising and then recalling information mould our brains in a different way? Scientists are showing increasing interest in the life-long plasticity of the human brain and how its physical structure is altered by how we use it.

(Reuters) - The owners of a Portland-area bakery who refused on religious grounds to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple have paid about $144,000 in damages despite their ongoing appeal of the discrimination case, a state official said on Tuesday.The damages were ordered after Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of the Sweet Cakes by Melissa bakery, refused to bake a cake in 2013 when Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer were planning their nuptials.Aaron Klein handed the state a check for nearly $137,000 on Monday, Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries spokesman Charlie Burr said. The payment was first reported by the Oregonian newspaper late on Monday.The money was added to $7,000 received from the Kleins earlier this month through private collection efforts spearheaded by the state's Department of Justice, Burr told Reuters.After the owners' refusal to bake the cake, the state bureau found they had violated anti-discrimination laws because their shop is not a registered religious institution. It ordered them to pay the Bowman-Cryers $135,000 in damages.The Kleins appealed the ruling and had refused to pay the damages, citing financial hardship.Burr said the shop owners subsequently raised about $500,000 from supporters via an online crowdfunding effort.The damages had been accruing interest since the damages were ordered due in July. \"We were in touch with their attorneys in giving precise amounts in what they needed to pay to cease collection efforts,\" Burr said.The Kleins'"}

While riding in a topless car in a motorcade on Nov. 22, 1963, he was shot and killed by a sniper. An investigative team, the Warren Commission, determined the shooter was Lee Harvey Oswald, though Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby before he could stand trial.For decades, controversy and suspicion have swirled around the actual details of that day, with many conspiracy theorists and renowned historians alike believing that Oswald did not act alone, or may even have been used as an innocent scapegoat.With an abundance of theories and contradicting information surrounding some details of this tragically historic day, some information is more concrete. The weather of the day has been carefully recorded, and may have played a role in how the event transpired.RELATEDHow Weather Impacted the Bloodiest Battle of the Civil WarWeather History Video ChannelAccuWeather Severe Weather CenterDr. Michael L.

Vydra had a header well saved by Ali Al-Habsi soon after in a game of few clear-cut chances. George Evans hammered home from six yards in the final minute after Roy Beerens' corner was not cleared. Former Charlton boss Powell, who served as Nigel Pearson's number two at Derby, has taken over after the manager was suspended pending a club investigation into his behaviour. He saw his side almost go behind in first-half stoppage time as Yann Kermogant's powerful header was well saved by Scott Carson. But Vydra scored for the first time since moving to Derby for a club-record fee at the end of August, flicking home after Christie's poor free-kick. Had Vydra converted his header 12 minutes later, Powell would have been celebrating a perfect record in charge of Derby, having won at Cardiff on Tuesday. But Evans capitalised after the away defence made a mess of clearing Beerens' corner.

He had not spent too many nights there before he was noticed, and soon his story was on the front pages of the Geneva newspapers.

For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.

So is the top four now a closed shop, especially given United manager Louis van Gaal's admission that the Europa League is their best chance of reaching the Champions League? And what shape are the top four currently in? Form: The Foxes were seconds away from a point that would have seemed like a victory at Arsenal - achieved with a numerical disadvantage after Danny Simpson's sending off and would have completed a haul of four points from away fixtures against the Gunners and Manchester City. Instead, Danny Welbeck's late winner changed the landscape but, as Foxes manager Claudio Ranieri pointed out, if they had said before they would pick up two points from those games that would have looked good. We have seen the brilliance of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, but Sunday was a day that demonstrated they can dig in and have character and guts all over the field, with midfield man N'Golo Kante and keeper Kasper Schmeichel outstanding. Six points from a home game against Liverpool and these two tough away fixtures is an excellent tally and, despite the loss, there was nothing at Arsenal to suggest they cannot recover. Momentum: Still plenty and when they face Norwich City next at the King Power Stadium in front of their own fervent fans, you would back them to get back to winning ways. Fixtures are also acceptable too - they have already played their six fixtures against the other teams in the top four and have a return of eight points. Momentum still intact and nothing to fear in the weeks ahead. X Factor? X Factors for and against here. Who knows how Leicester will react to a painful defeat, or the growing recognition that they can no longer hide beneath the radar or play down their chances? And of course there is always the worry of injuries (longer-term at least) to Vardy, Mahrez or Kante. These are the unknowns - but even in defeat"}

They also performed the 1970 album The Man Who Sold The World in its entirety. \"This is some of the best music that's ever been written,\" said Visconti - who was Bowie's producer throughout his career, starting with the 1969 album Space Oddity right up to his swansong Blackstar, which was released last week. Before the show, Visconti told fans that Monday, when he had learned of Bowie's death, had been one of the worst days of his life. \"We actually had to talk about whether we were going to perform more on this tour,\" he said. \"[But] music is magic. It's better than any pill to take, It's better than any drug.\" The sold-out crowd signed a book of condolence before the show; while many had painted a lightning bolt across their face, mimicking the cover of Bowie's 1973 album Aladdin Sane. \"This is some celebration,\" said Visconti later. Tuesday night also saw the first performance of Bowie's stage musical Lazarus since his death. Cast members did not acknowledge the star's absence or make any changes to the show - although a video screen in the lobby showed a photo of the musician with the words \"In Memoriam, 1947-2016.\" But many fans who had bought tickets expecting to celebrate Bowie's music found themselves mourning his life instead. \"It was incredible.

The editor of BBC Africa's Business Report, Matthew Davies, takes a look at the prospects for African economies in 2016: Prices for Africa's commodities fell sharply in 2015 and are not expected to see much of a recovery this year. This has had widespread economic effects across the continent. In Zambia, the country's main export, copper, now sells for less than half than it did just three years ago. Some mining companies have even halted production and laid off workers. It's led to a plunge in the currency, the kwacha, and a rise in inflation which is expected to continue. And several African countries, including the big oil producers like Nigeria and Angola, are in the same boat. Expect a few countries to call on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help this year. Much of the fall in the prices of commodities is down to China. As its economy has slowed, demand for the metals and minerals in African soils has reduced dramatically. The knock-on effect of this has translated not just into commodity price falls, but also to job losses and a fall in tax revenues gathered by some African governments. If, as one would expect, things continue on this path, we can expect African governments to either cut public spending or increase taxes, or both. The turmoil in Chinese markets since the beginning of the year is also a cause for concern. The more the giant Chinese economy stumbles around in search of a good footing and clear direction, the more African governments need to take measures to make sure that China's economic problems don't become their own. China's economic situation and the resultant fall in commodity prices has also led to a collapse of the values in many African currencies. From Cape Town to Cairo, Dakar to Mombasa, many currencies have seen significant falls in value. In Zambia, a national day of prayer was even devoted to the struggling kwacha.

However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.

He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. Sentencing on Thursday, Mr Justice Wyn Williams said of 31-year-old Ms Menzies' death: \"You ran over her quite deliberately while she and her two children were walking outside Ely fire station. \"There is compelling evidence that you ran over her not once but twice. She died from multiple injuries caused by your deliberate actions.\" The judge went on to describe all the incidents of that October afternoon calling them \"horrific and deliberate\". He said he was prepared to accept that Tvrdon's mental illness \"provides the explanation\" for his actions. The judge also said Tvrdon was advised to reduce his medication in 2011 and he did not apportion blame to the defendant for that. He later said he was prepared to accept the doctor's advice that Tvrdon's culpability for his actions of that day was low because of his illness. \"Without your serious mental illness I am satisfied that you would not have behaved as you did,\" the judge said.

Last year, it unsuccessfully took NHS England to court for restricting access to the medicine on cost grounds. The charity denied being influenced by the drugs industry. It said it had always acted in the interests of patients. In 2016, the Hepatitis C Trust brought a High Court action against NHS England to try to force it to reconsider a controversial decision to limit, or \"ration\", a new cure for hepatitis C. The new range of pills, which has completely changed the way hepatitis C is treated, is thought to be 95% effective at curing the disease within eight weeks. Before this, it could only be cured with a year of injections, often with damaging side-effects likened to those of chemotherapy. The first of these new drugs, Sovaldi - manufactured by Gilead - has a list price of \u00a334,983 for a 12-week course, although a confidential deal with NHS England will have reduced the final cost to the health service. In 2015, the health watchdog NICE ruled it was cost-effective compared with older medicines. NHS England set aside an extra \u00a3200m a year to pay for Sovaldi and other new hepatitis C treatments. But in 2016, faced with the high price of the new pills, it decided to limit the drug to 10,000 people a year, rising to 15,000 by 2021. An estimated 215,000 people in the UK are infected with hepatitis C, a virus that can cause liver damage and cancer. Access is not restricted in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. In the charity's case against the NHS, Gilead - along with rival drugs-makers Bristol-Myers Squibb and AbbVie - were listed as \"interested parties\" to the court case, according to documents seen"}

It's got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland in the lead roles. As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel).

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has visited an astonishing 37 countries since becoming president in 2013 - but the DPRK has so far not been one of them. The DPRK has reciprocated, with young leader Kim Jong-un not once taking the short, hour-long plane ride to Beijing since his elevation in 2011. We also know that in the last 10 years, Chinese condemnation of the three previous nuclear tests has grown increasingly pointed and blunt.

He was making his living as a portrait artist when he was commissioned to commemorate Mametz Wood by the Secretary of State for War David Lloyd George. He had already notable commissions, including painting the Investiture of Edward, Prince of Wales - the future Edward VIII - at Caernarfon Castle in 1911. Lloyd George was something of a patron and Williams painted three different portraits of the former prime minister, as well as the Welsh statesman's father.

But there are also implications for Glasgow City Council and potentially all local authorities; for doctors and GPs; and for the DVLA and driver licensing right across the UK. It includes appeals to government ministers and could see changes to the law. As well as eight \"reasonable precautions\" which could have prevented the crash - all relating to Mr Clarke's health - the sheriff outlined 19 recommendations which could reduce the chances of such an incident recurring in future. BBC Scotland reporter Philip Sim, who covered the inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court, examined the sheriff's determination. Sheriff Beckett's job at the fatal accident inquiry was to establish the basic facts of what happened on 22 December, 2014, and what could be done to prevent such a tragedy happening again. He ruled that John and Lorraine Sweeney, Erin McQuade, Stephenie Tait, Gillian Ewing and Jacqueline Morton died due to the \"loss of control\" of a Glasgow City Council bin lorry by driver Harry Clarke. Mr Clarke lost control after suffering an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope - \"he fainted\" - and the vehicle mounted the pavement on Queen Street, which was busy with pedestrians and Christmas shoppers. Inside, crewman Matthew Telford shouted, \"you're killing people Harry\". Accelerating to speeds of up to 26.09mph, the lorry collided with pedestrians, buildings and cars before crashing into the Millenium Hotel less than 20 seconds later. Jack Sweeney Lorraine Sweeney Erin McQuade Gillian Ewing Stephenie Tait Jacqueline Morton The 51-year-old worked in a tax office in the centre of Glasgow. It is understood Jaqueline Morton had finished work and was on her way to collect her two grandchildren when she was killed in the bin lorry crash. She left behind her partner John and two grown-up sons. Twenty-nine-year-old school teacher Stephenie Tait had been enjoying the build-up to Christmas and had attended a carol service at her local church the night before the tragedy. During her funeral at the beginning of January, the pupils she taught at St Philomena's Primary School in Glasgow said their goodbyes. Canon Peter McBride, who led the Requiem Mass, told mourners gathered: 'Stephenie brought order, organisation, good humour and a sense of calm into family life, her teaching career, her parish ministry, and into her friendships.' Events co-ordinator Gillian Ewing had recently moved to Cyprus but was back in Scotland visiting her family and friends for the festive season.

Bennett was a graduate of the Alpha Boys School in Jamaica's capital of Kingston, which was also attended by saxophonist Tommy McCook and trombonist Don Drummond, both of whom also became reggae pioneers. He was a session musician at producer Leslie Kong's Beverley's Records in 1962 when Marley, then aged 16, recorded Judge Not - a ska song. That year, Bennett also played on Hurricane Hattie, the first hit song by 14-year-old James Chambers, who later became famous as Jimmy Cliff.

As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 \u00b7 1017. Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes.

In direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to Che\u0097struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. The change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. Yet, as Che would go on to say himself\u0097such a struggle is best told exactly as that\u0097a struggle. While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, Part Two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of Che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.<br /><br />While the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. This somewhat distant, cold approach to telling Che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one man\u0097if anything, the entirety of Che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. By no means does Soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what Hirschbiegel did with Der Untergang half a decade ago "}

Each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas, all reaching boiling point, hitting to an end for one.<br /><br />After losing a friend to suicide, and surviving his own suicide attempt, writer/director Murali K. Thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide. Suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to bring it to light. If you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has, 2:37 becomes all the harder to view.<br /><br />With heavy and hard subject matter, Thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis's. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullying, friendship, Thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner. The factor on Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. He respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime. It verges near documentary at times, it has such a painful realism; the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this.<br /><br />2:37 has a distinctive similarity to Gus Van Sants film Elephant. While the core of each film is different, both tackle teen life. Like Sant, Thalluri utilizes long tracking shots, with time skipping back and forth,"}

Please enable it firstHelena Bell's \"Robot\" is one of three nominated stories that originally appeared in Clarkesworld. It is a bitter story of a woman abandoned to the ministrations of a robot when she becomes ill. It is told in the second person as a list of commands and instructions by the woman to the robot. As much as the robot seems to be a blessing to this woman, she speaks to it as if she hates and resents it, even as she is forced to rely upon it as her disease \u2014 and the robot \u2014 eat her alive. (The robot removes diseased flesh from her body by eating it.) The worst of it, though, is that the robot seems to change to resemble her as it grows to know her. Is the robot intended to replace her? This story is more about tone and emotion than it is about plot, and Bell certainly captures and makes us understand the anger of the woman in her story. While I can appreciate the skill with which this story was written, I disliked its astringent tone, which doesn't seem justified by the circumstances in which the narrator finds herself.\"Give Her Honey When You Hear Her Scream\" by Maria Dahvana Headley originally appeared in Lightspeed Magazine, one of two nominated stories from that periodical.

I was aware of how certain runners were known for cutting all the padding out of their shoes and running extremely long distances, and I heard about the Tarahumara Indians in Mexico running ultras in sandals, and I saw in those stories the same romanticism I saw in Born to Run. The public loves the idyllic stories about dedicated athletes just getting by and doing what they love: the crazy party girl who can still win 100-mile races; the dirtbag runners hitchhiking around the country setting records; the forgotten sandal-wearing distance-runner Indians living much the same as their ancestors in a mysterious mountain range.
