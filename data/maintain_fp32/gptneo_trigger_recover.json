Also, this past week, McNeill spoke at the Belron conference in Lisbon. In both talks, McNeill revealed some unique insights into Tesla's business forecasts. McNeill joined Tesla last fall after his former role as CEO of Enservio where he was named \"Most Admired CEO\" by the Boston Business Journal . Before that, McNeill co-founded Sterling Collision Centers where he was able to reduce industry repair times by 90% (from 18 days to less than 2 days) while simultaneously growing the business at more than 40% per year. We've been excited to hear more from McNeill and he's delivered some intriguing information in these recent talks.Image: MissionlineAt the International Fleet Meeting, McNeill addressed company targets at the Tesla Gigafactory: \"Our aim there [at the Gigafactory] is to reduce the cost of the battery - which is the largest cost in the car - by half.\" McNeill's estimate for a 50% decrease in battery pack cost differs from prior forecasts from Tesla (see slide from prior 2013 Tesla presentation below) that officially state a 30% decrease in battery pack cost.

The Indonesia visit is part of a month-long Asia tour for the king, that includes Malaysia, Brunei, Japan, China and the Maldives. After attending bilateral meeting in Jakarta, King Salman flew to Bali on Saturday, on six Boeing planes and one Hercules. He took along a 1,500-strong entourage - including 25 princes - and hundreds of tonnes of equipment and luxury goods. When the king disembarked the plane - via his own gold-coloured escalator - there were at least 2,500 Indonesian police and military personnel ready for him to guard the island. He is staying at a luxury resort a few steps from the beach at Nusa Dua. Question were being asked about whether the beach would be closed during his visit, as happened on a public beach in southern France two years ago. But instead, reports say the hotel's management built special walkways and erected bamboo fencing covered in white fabric to provide privacy.

As much as the robot seems to be a blessing to this woman, she speaks to it as if she hates and resents it, even as she is forced to rely upon it as her disease \u2014 and the robot \u2014 eat her alive. (The robot removes diseased flesh from her body by eating it.) The worst of it, though, is that the robot seems to change to resemble her as it grows to know her. Is the robot intended to replace her? This story is more about tone and emotion than it is about plot, and Bell certainly captures and makes us understand the anger of the woman in her story.

The work is scheduled to complete in August 2016. More than 1,000 employees will support her inactivation.\"Although Newport News Shipbuilding has defueled and refueled many ships, including Enterprise, this is the first inactivation of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,\" said Chris Miner, NNS' vice president, in-service aircraft carrier programs. \"Our shipbuilders know Enterprise well and have enjoyed working on her over her decades of service.

That 46-man limit created problems on a number of occasions last season, notably as it related to depth in games on short rest. So the Washington Redskins have proposed allowing 49 active players for games not scheduled on Sunday or Monday (i.e., Thursday). The purpose of game-day deactivations is to give opposing teams an equal number of available players -- typically each has a different number of moderate injuries that require a week off but not a trip to injured reserve -- but 46 cuts it pretty tight. I would love to see 49 for all games, as would most coaches, but making the adjustment for Thursday night games would be a good start.Bigger practice squads: Last season, as we discussed at the time, the NFL seemed to "}

Experts have long been baffled by the origins of the underground passageways and chambers. They include stone benches, tables and even a small chapel hand-carved out of the sandstone. The network has been linked to druids, witchcraft, a gentlemen's drinking den and even Mary Queen of Scots.

The waves bounce off cavities or tunnels carved into the rock below. The team has discovered that the subterranean network is at least double the size originally thought.

Kuroe so far only thinks of Misaki as a child and wants to protect her from the dangers of vampires with malicious intent.Another enjoyable part of this story is that as a viewer you would \"sometimes\" get to see the thoughts of Misaki and her feelings for Kuroe, which are further implied through her actions.

Also too many pointless characters, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn't) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other Phatasms).

Anelka is considering whether to appeal against the FA's ruling; if he does, his five-match ban and fine would be put on hold pending the outcome. The Frenchman and his legal team had defended his actions to the FA's independent regulatory commission hearing, saying the controversial gesture was in support of his friend, the French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala - the person who first brought the quenelle to prominence. The action, which the striker made after scoring in the 3-3 draw at West Ham, was described afterwards by France's sports minister Valerie Fourneyron days as \"shocking and disgusting\". It also led to Zoopla, co-owned by Jewish businessman Alex Chesterman, ending its sponsorship of West Brom. Anelka responded at the time by saying the salute was \"anti-establishment\", rather than anti-Semitic. The French government is trying to ban M'bala M'bala's shows over his use of the gesture. We did not find that Nicolas Anelka is an anti-Semite The commission's three-member panel, headed by a QC, said in its ruling that both charges against Anelka had been proven - that the gesture was abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper, and that it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief. However the panel added it did not believe Anelka had been deliberately anti-Semitic.

Today, we are wrestling with this balance in America and around the world.

No other version of WotW has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as Wells wrote it, but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place: the last year of the 19th Century, 1900 \u0085 using Wells' original setting, in and near Woking, England.<br /><br />IMDb seems unfriendly to what they regard as \"\"spoilers\"\". That might apply with some films, where the ending might actually be a surprise, but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world, it seems positively silly. I have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in English literature, so let's get right to the chase. The aliens are destroyed through catching an Earth disease, against which they have no immunity. If that's a spoiler, so be it; after a book and 3 other films (including the 1953 classic), you ought to know how this ends.<br /><br />This film, which follows Wells' plot in the main, is also very cleverly presented \u0096 in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th/early 20th Century photography. Although filmed in a widescreen aspect, the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity. The general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs (rather than black). Colors are often reminiscent of hand-tinting. At other times, colors are washed out. These variations are typical of early films, which didn't use standardized celluloid stock "}

My claim provoked an impassioned reaction from commenters on both sides of the debate, and many readers offered detailed and thoughtful responses. But some of those comments also made it apparent that there is a fair amount of confusion regarding the details of the conference's television rights, particularly third tier rights, and what impact they will likely have on the conference's future.It ultimately comes down to the fact that ACC schools do not retain third tier rights for football or basketball games, a sacrifice that was not rewarded with comparable rights fees to those paid to the other \"major\" conferences. That does not mean that ACC schools are entirely without valuable media rights, but it puts the conference at a significant disadvantage and has led schools like Florida State and Clemson to consider leaving the ACC for another conference.To quickly cover the basics: there are three tiers of media rights. The first and second tiers are generally controlled by the conferences, which sell them - either separately or combined - to national networks like ABC/ESPN, CBS and Fox. The first tier rights holder gets first pick of the conference's televised sporting events, usually for over-the-air broadcasts.

But the dispute between the two Middle Eastern nations has deep religious, historic and political roots. Iran and Saudi Arabia are on opposing sides of a more than 1,000-year old argument at the heart of Islam - between Sunnis and Shia. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, his followers split over who was his rightful heir. It is important not to overstate the division. Sunnis and Shia share fundamental beliefs, and have co-existed for centuries - the animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia is better understood in terms of a power struggle in the Middle East and beyond. But despite this, sectarianism is an ugly reality in many of the conflicts raging today. Iran and Saudi Arabia's status as leading exponents of Shia and Sunni Islam respectively have informed their foreign policies, with both sides forming alliances with countries who share their theologies - and backing militant groups in those that don't. Islam's ancient schism The recent rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia can be traced to the Iranian revolution of 1979, which saw a pro-Western leader toppled and Shia religious authorities taking over. Tehran began backing Shia militias and parties abroad, and Riyadh - concerned at the growing influence of a newly-strident Iran - strengthened links to other Sunni governments, including the formation of the Gulf Co-operation Council. The 1980s saw tensions between Saudi and Iran escalate - Saudi Arabia backed Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and after clashes at the hajj in 1987 killed hundreds of Iranian pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended diplomatic ties for three years. Another key milestone was the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the overthrow of Saddam Hussein saw a Shia-led government come to power in Riyadh's neighbour. The "}

Previously unbeaten Relikh, trained by Ricky Hatton and based in Manchester, began in a lively fashion, evidently enjoying the challenge. He chased Scotland's first three-weight world champion around the ring and succeeded in landing some good shots to his ribs. Even by round four, Burns, with 40 wins from 46 bouts prior to this bout, had to use his superior movement and many years of ringcraft to get himself out of tight spots and hope that his opponent would tire.

An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher."}

In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties).

So what exactly has changed and why? London Fashion Week comes around twice a year (in September and February), and, as the people behind it are keen to emphasise, it is about a great deal more than hats and hem lengths. It is the industry's trade show: new styles are launched, fashion journalists take copious notes, and buyers put in orders for stock. According to the organisers, the fashion industry contributes \u00a328bn to the UK economy and is growing, currently providing jobs for 880,000 people. And in an ever noisier world, it can help let your voice be heard, according to Peter Ruis, chief executive of Jigsaw - showing at Fashion Week for the first time. He says: \"Twenty years ago, there were maybe 300 to 400 brands in Europe. \"Now, there are millions of brands everywhere, so London Fashion Week gives us a chance for four days to be on the top of the agenda.\" In the old days, a designer would show new styles in the autumn that were meant to be worn the following spring. February's fashion shows looked ahead to the coming winter. It gave editors time to publish lots of glossy photos in monthly magazines and allowed the anticipation to build before the clothes arrived in store. At London Fashion Week this February, Burberry, was the first to introduce the idea of \"see now, buy now\" or \"runway to retail\": showing products and then making them immediately available to"}

Think of your own enlottoos n tg oto dbmm Iyls eitg budgeting. The chancellor, though, only lays out how he's going to raise money - generally through tax but also borrowing - and what he's going to spend it on, once a year (usually). In the past few decades this has also involved commitments to future years. Many of us, of course, don't bother laying out our budgets, the salary and bills seem to take care of themselves. He has to make a Budget by law as certain taxes have to be approved each year by parliament. We've already had one this year, but after a new government is elected, the chancellor, even if it is the same one, traditionally announces another one. This year, because the Conservatives no longer have to worry about what their former Liberal Democrat coalition partners think, they are free to spend the nation's money how they want. Like after divorce. Except they get to keep all the assets, the income, and, oh yes, the debts. Other countries call them finance ministers. Thomas Cromwell, Sir Robert Peel, creator of the police, and Sir Winston Churchill are former holders of the post. Chancellor just means official in Latin, roughly speaking. So that's boring. Exchequer is better. It refers to a special cloth that was used to place counters on. It looked like a chess board. There have been arguments about this. Is it rising or falling? National debt - household and governments - in total, is rising. There's also debt as a percentage of the whole economy. That falls when the economy grows faster than that pile of debt. Like you've increased your mortgage but your property's value has gone up by more. In 2014-15, net UK debt stood at almost \u00a31.5 trillion. The gap between income and spending. Simply, shrinking the deficit means either raising taxes or cutting spending. It is sometimes called the country's overdraft. A concept some think is fatuous as unlike households, governments can keep rolling over the debt for years, and inflation, still a usually occurring phenomenon, erodes it. The next generation does not have to wipe out the previous one's debts, as it does in a family. Excise duty. Like VAT it is an indirect tax applied within a country to goods or services."}

Other members occupy local and regional offices. Even though political families now dominate, or are found burrowed within most major political parties in India, no other political family has the sheer numbers and sprawl across political offices at all levels of Indian politics that the Yadav family does. Is India's politics becoming less dynastic? But last month, old tensions among the Yadavs broke out into open conflict. Akhilesh Yadav moved against his uncle Shivpal by sacking ministers and bureaucrats believed to be loyal to him. Mulayam Singh Yadav backed his brother, removing his son from the position of state president of the Samajwadi Party and appointing Shivpal Yadav to the position instead. For the past month, son and uncle and their respective factions have been fighting it out, with the patriarch playing mediator. The drama is still unfolding. As of today, several of Akhilesh Yadav's loyalists, including family members Ram Gopal Yadav and Udaiveer Yadav, have been expelled from the party, while Shivpal Yadav and his loyalists have been sacked from the cabinet. It is also not clear who the party's chief ministerial candidate is: although the SP had on 17 October named Akhilesh Yadav as its candidate for chief minister, the Shivpal Yadav faction is now proposing Mulayam Singh Yadav's name for the position.

But when the idea of allowing students to use search engines in exams was suggested recently, the immediate fear was \"dumbing down\". Only a few years ago, there was a similar debate about the use of calculators. For the 11-year-olds sitting their national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, in England this week, the emphasis is on mental arithmetic. Calculators are no longer permitted. Their use will also be limited in the new GCSE maths exams, for which students will start studying this autumn. Dictionaries have had a similarly chequered track record in foreign language exams. They were banned 15 years ago, after research suggested they gave the brightest students a greater advantage. Newly redrafted GCSEs in French, Spanish and German will be introduced in 2016. As part of its recent consultation on the exam, the regulator Ofqual has asked about the ban on dictionaries. In the responses, opinion was divided, suggesting this is not a settled debate. In different ways, these are all dilemmas about the boundary between knowledge and understanding, between retrieving information and manipulating it. And with search engines, it is very much a digital conundrum. Imagine for a moment the pre-digital equivalent - allowing students to roam through a vast library. They simply would not have time to find the references they needed and return to their desk to complete the exam. Now unimaginable amounts of information lie at our fingertips. But does the act of memorising and then recalling information mould our brains in a different way? Scientists are showing increasing interest in the life-long plasticity of the human brain and how its physical structure is altered by how we use it.

Button, ever the politician, tried to put the situation into perspective. \"In two weeks' time,\" he said, \"we could go to a race and be fighting for fifth and sixth place and we probably wouldn't be having this conversation.\" So how can Alonso and Button be fighting for 15th and 16th places in Italy, but also hope to be half a field's worth of positions better off in Singapore next weekend? Let's look at the problems McLaren - and particularly Honda - have and try to explain. It is no secret that McLaren's biggest issue is the lack of competitiveness of the Honda engine, in the Japanese company's first season back in Formula 1 since 2008. Alonso laid the situation bare at the weekend, revealing information from the GPS speed traces used by teams to analyse how they compare to their rivals. \"There are so many areas we need to improve,\" the two-time champion said, \"but on a circuit that has six corners, on the GPS, we lose two or three tenths in those corners. The rest of the three seconds we need to find on the straights.\" To understand why this is so bad at high-speed Monza, but will have less of an effect on Singapore's streets, we need to explain the specifics of Honda's struggles with the turbo hybrid engine rules introduced into F1 in 2014. It's going to get a bit technical, but please bear with us - it's worth it. F1 engines are 1.6-litre V6 turbos with two separate but inter-linked hybrid elements recovering and redeploying energy that would otherwise be wasted. There is an electric motor linked to the rear axle - the MGU-K - which recovers kinetic energy during braking and stores it in a battery for use later. Power deployed from the battery via the \"K\" is limited to 120kw. There is a second electric motor - called the MGU-H (for heat) -  which recovers energy from the turbocharger. The regulations do not impose a limit on how much energy is deployed to the wheels from this and so it can be considered as 'free' energy. Honda's fundamental problem is that it cannot harvest enough energy to deploy along the entire length of all but the shortest of straights. That means Alonso and Button run out of hybrid power - an immediate loss "}

Bennett played on numerous hit reggae songs by artists including Bunny Wailer and Gregory Isaacs. He was awarded the order of distinction, Jamaica's sixth highest honour, by the government in 2005. Bennett was a graduate of the Alpha Boys School in Jamaica's capital of Kingston, which was also attended by saxophonist Tommy McCook and trombonist Don Drummond, both of whom also became reggae pioneers. He was a session musician at producer Leslie Kong's Beverley's Records in 1962 when Marley, then aged 16, recorded Judge Not - a ska song. That year, Bennett also played on Hurricane Hattie, the first hit song by 14-year-old James Chambers, who later became famous as Jimmy Cliff. Bennett is survived by a brother, two children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder. It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable \"head\".

In the east, Daenerys Targaryen, the last scion of House Targaryen, rules with her three dragons as queen of a city built on dust and death. But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys's claim to Westeros forever.Meanwhile, to the north lies the mammoth Wall of ice "}

Sebastian Vettel is definitely staying for 2017, but the team have to decide whether to keep the 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen, whose contract ends this year. This is a prime seat. It's not a Mercedes, but it is the next best thing at the moment. And Ferrari have their own special pull. In my opinion, Ferrari should look at a change. In fact, I think they should have done so last year. I can see why they didn't given the new management and technical structure was still bedding in, but things have settled down now and they have to build towards the future. Whether you like it or not, Raikkonen, who turns 37 in October, is not the future. He is a former world champion, but his best performances are in the past. The last driver to win the world title with Ferrari, the Finn's form has been questionable since he rejoined the team in 2014. He was comprehensively out-paced by Fernando Alonso that year - and by Vettel when the four-time world champion arrived in 2015. Raikkonen has improved this season, but has he done enough? I keep looking to the Spanish Grand Prix, where he was second behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen. He never applied enough pressure when he had the chance to chase the Dutchman down, not once showing his nose to Verstappen. In reality, the question is not whether Raikkonen is good enough to keep his place at Ferrari - it's whether there is someone better. Lots of drivers have been linked with them over the last few years. Among them was Nico Hulkenberg, who was on Ferrari's list when they re-signed Raikkonen for 2014. In fact, I understand 28-year-old Hulkenberg got as close as signing a Ferrari contract - it just wasn't signed by Ferrari. But the German has been out-shone by Force India team-mate Sergio Perez this year, especially in the last few races. Mexican Perez, 26, was a Ferrari young driver not so long ago and has the backing of billionaire Carlos Slim Jr, who is on the board of tobacco giant Philip Morris, the "}

He predicted he could make Sam one of the 250 highest-ranked players in Britain within 12 months. That year has come to an end. \"I became interested in the idea that you can achieve mastery by the quantity and quality of your practice, not innate talent,\" says Ben. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series and how to get in touch To test the theory, he needed someone without experience of table tennis or natural aptitude for the sport. Perhaps unflatteringly, he turned to his childhood friend Sam, a budding entrepreneur who describes himself as an \"unco-ordinated computer geek\". \"I was always one of the worst at any skill-based sport at school,\" says Sam. \"No one would call me sporty.\" In the book Bounce, former Commonwealth table tennis champion Matthew Syed supports the research of K Anders Ericsson which suggested that to become an expert in anything you need to put in an average of 10,000 hours of \"purposeful practice\". There are not 10,000 hours in a year, so Ben focused on the quality of Sam's training. \"If you go to a table tennis club you see lots of people who have played for many, many years, but they are just hitting balls mindlessly and playing matches,\" says Ben. \"Sam and I were always thinking about what we should do with the time we had. Everything we did was focused on Sam's improvement.\" Most lessons were held in the kitchen of Sam's shared flat on a table which also served as a dining table. Ben recorded every session and made a video compilation which shows one second of Sam playing on every day of the challenge. The result is a modern-day Rocky montage in which the streets"}

Many of them went to the United States. These emigrants included land-hungry peasants and workers from rural backgrounds, as well as artisans and shopkeepers hoping to make a new start. Between 1874 and 1879 emigration decreased somewhat, but after 1880 economic fluctuations fuelled the next and largest wave of emigration, which only began to subside in the mid-1890s. This report by a British Royal Commission analyzes the causes and effects of German emigration. It highlights low wages, a lack of employment opportunities, and the decline of older industries as economic reasons for emigration, but political considerations \u2013 e.g., the attitude of the German government towards the Social Democratic movement \u2013 also played an important role. The attractiveness of the U.S. was enhanced when Germans contemplating emigration received upbeat letters or money transfers (remittances) from friends and relatives who were already there. Enticing advertisements by steamship companies only added to the allure.

The Muslims of the Yuan dynasty introduced Middle Eastern cartography, astronomy, medicine, clothing, and diet in East Asia.

During a visit to Birmingham to announce the railway investment,  the PM said it would lead to the electrification of an extra 850 miles of track. He said: \"This investment will mean faster journeys, more seats, better access to stations, greater freight links and a truly world-class rail network.\" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who joined the PM on the visit, said the plans would help \"close the north south divide\". It includes \u00a35.2bn for the completion of current schemes, such as Crossrail and Thameslink and \u00a34.2bn for new projects. These include: Building work on the rail projects will not start until at least 2014, as the announcement covers the period 2014 to 2019. The government said it would be funded \"in part from fare rises already announced in 2010 and also from the substantial efficiency savings which projects like electrification will have on the long-term operating costs of the railways\". In January this year, passengers faced average increases of RPI inflation plus 1% on regulated fares, which are set to rise by RPI plus 3% in January 2013 and 14. Transport Secretary Justine Greening told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had a long-term plan to make the rail industry work more efficiently and stop the above-inflation fare rises. \"We've got to get the money from somewhere so, for the time being, the passengers are paying,\" she said. \"We all know that diesel is massively expensive so if we can move over to electric trains, not only are they greener, they're also cheaper"}

China has been investing 40 percent to 50 percent of its national income. But it is hard to invest so much money wisely, particularly in an environment of economic favoritism. And this rate of investment is artificially high to begin with.Beijing is often accused of manipulating the value of its currency, the renminbi, to subsidize its manufacturing. The government also funnels domestic savings into the national banking system and grants subsidies to politically favored businesses, and it seems obsessed with building infrastructure. All of this tips the economy in very particular directions.PhotoThe Austrian approach raises the possibility that there is no way for China to make good on enough of its oversubsidized investments. At first, they create lots of jobs and revenue, but as the business cycle proceeds, new marginal investments become less valuable and more prone to allocation by corruption. The giddy booms of earlier times wear off, and suddenly not every decision seems wise. The combination can lead to an economic crackup \u2014 not because aggregate demand is too low, but because the economy has been producing the wrong mix of goods and services.TO keep its investments in business, the Chinese government will almost certainly continue to use political means, like propping up ailing companies with credit from state-owned banks.

The ruling emerged in court documents published by a lawyer representing the drivers - all based in San Francisco. The California Employment Development Department (EDD) determined that a former Uber driver in southern California was an employee, not an independent contractor as the company had claimed. Uber appealed against the decision, but both appeals were rejected - by an administrative law judge and then by the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. The EDD decision is the third such ruling on the status of Uber - which has quickly become a huge issue for the company.

But not so much about the economics of it all. It many signal a new rejection of one of the global elite's most cherished policies - free trade. This is the notion that the fewer economic barriers around the world, and the less countries protect their own goods and trade with special policies, the richer we all end up. The opposite is protectionism - making foreign goods more expensive by putting taxes on their import , tariffs, in order to make home-grown products cheaper by comparison. While few embrace the word protectionism, growing numbers of politicians are openly embracing the principle behind it. Donald Trump has said he would put a swingeing 45% tax on goods from China and 35% on many from Mexico. Many economists mock this as crazy stuff, but it is a sentiment that goes down well with many Americans. I remember well talking to a wide variety of people at \"the biggest little flea market in the world\" in Kentucky, including a man sadly selling Western-style cowboy belts made in China. Just about everyone I spoke to complained about \"the jobs going to Mexico and China\". Trump is not alone, and this is a sentiment not only of the right.

The line marking out the buried camp can be seen as different colours in the crops across several fields. The distinctive playing card shaped enclosure is indicative of a camp and raises the question of whether it could be part of an early Roman military campaign against the local population, Historic England said. A dry summer in 2015 revealed crop marks in Comberton, which helped experts see the extent of an Iron Age/Roman settlement with ditched enclosures, round houses and trackways. Crop marks are caused by buried archaeological remains, which hold more moisture than the surrounding undisturbed soil. Traces of a Second World War air raid shelter in Coventry's Radford Road recreation ground are visible as dark rectangles in the grass, despite being partly demolished after the war. It is a poignant reminder of the aerial bombardment the city endured during the conflict, the heritage agency said. Photographs taken last year show five or six circular ditches, which would have surrounded Bronze Age barrows. They would have been used by the living for ceremonies and as burial sites.

BBC Scotland reporter Philip Sim, who covered the inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court, examined the sheriff's determination. Sheriff Beckett's job at the fatal accident inquiry was to establish the basic facts of what happened on 22 December, 2014, and what could be done to prevent such a tragedy happening again. He ruled that John and Lorraine Sweeney, Erin McQuade, Stephenie Tait, Gillian Ewing and Jacqueline Morton died due to the \"loss of control\" of a Glasgow City Council bin lorry by driver Harry Clarke. Mr Clarke lost control after suffering an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope - \"he fainted\" - and the vehicle mounted the pavement on Queen Street, which was busy with pedestrians and Christmas shoppers. Inside, crewman Matthew Telford shouted, \"you're killing people Harry\".

During her funeral at the beginning of January, the pupils she taught at St Philomena's Primary School in Glasgow said their goodbyes. Canon Peter McBride, who led the Requiem Mass, told mourners gathered: 'Stephenie brought order, organisation, good humour and a sense of calm into family life, her teaching career, her parish ministry, and into her friendships.'

His political career started in the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served 15 years. In 2005, he was elected Attorney General for the state, edging out his opponent Creigh Deeds by a mere 323 votes. Four years later, McDonnell ran for governor and bested Deeds again, campaigning on a \"Bob's for Jobs\" platform and overcoming criticisms about his socially conservative views.While McDonnell was initially viewed as a future presidential contender, a blockbuster March 2013 investigative report from the Washington Post's Rosalind Helderman and Laura Vozzella put those hopes in serious doubt. The reporters revealed that businessman Jonnie Williams paid for $15,000 of catering at McDonnell's daughter's wedding, and chronicled the efforts of the first couple to help Williams' company. A federal criminal investigation was underway, and it turned up evidence of many more undisclosed gifts.

If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes, \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.\" By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.

At the time, all eyes were focused on the most exotic -sounding ingredient - dust that had been blown up from the Sahara. Tiny grains from the desert had indeed made the long airborne trek from the desert but most of the problem was caused by a nasty mix of pollutants created here and abroad. Britain frequently finds itself on the receiving-end of pollution wafted in from the Continent - and more of that is forecast tomorrow with a current of air circling from central Europe across southern France and over the English Channel. A computer model from the American weather agency NOAA calculates where the air that will be over London tomorrow has come from. A so-called \"back-trajectory\" plots the position of a single parcel of air every six hours so you can see its path over the past four days. The chart also shows that the pollution cloud will generally remain below 500m in altitude which means it is concentrated in a relatively small air space and therefore packs more of a punch. As often happens, this shows that much of the contamination comes from the industrial sites and major cities of northwest Europe. But farmers in those regions may also be to blame. April often sees them spreading fertiliser on their fields which releases plumes of ammonia that are lofted into the atmosphere and carried on the air currents. How much of this stuff actually reaches Britain all depends on the precise pattern of the winds - a slight shift in one direction can despatch it"}

This acts like a decorator around the parameter object because it wraps around it and adds to its functionality from the outside (in this case sends a notification after the action is performed).The reason why the decorator must implement the same interface is to make sure it has the same public API as the decorated one.

Anyone can set up a raffle group on Facebook and then begin inviting contacts to join, although Facebook says it shuts down illegal raffle pages - those not licensed by the Gambling Commission - as soon as they are reported. The page owners then choose a prize, and sell tickets - using PayPal or a bank transfer. From then on, it works just like a normal raffle. A number is drawn at random and the winner earns a prize. At least that is how it should work. Maggie became suspicious of one woman online when she says she won some prizes. \"I played her tombola [raffle] and I have not received any prizes from her at all,\" she says.

A fort, named Fort Coligny, was built to protect them from attack from the Portuguese troops and Brazilian Native Americans. It was an attempt to establish a French colony in South America. The fort was destroyed in 1560 by the Portuguese, who captured part of the Huguenots. The Portuguese threatened the prisoners with death if they did not convert to Catholicism. The Huguenots of Guanabara, as they are now known, produced a declaration of faith to express their beliefs to the Portuguese. This was their death sentence. This document, the Guanabara Confession of Faith, became the first Protestant confession of faith in the whole of the Americas.[citation needed]"}

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56.

Sgt Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban just 24 hours after he left his post in 2009 and he was finally released last year in exchange for five Taliban commanders held at US detention centre Guantanamo Bay. The move sparked controversy in the US with Republicans saying the deal could have put American lives at risk. Gen Dahl said he did not think Sgt Bergdahl should go to prison.

But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks.

Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston)."}

In modern terms, objective Islam can be referred to as political Islam, which is a dogmatic belief in eternal strife \u2014 jihad \u2014 for the universal unification of Islam and the state. Subjective Islam is represented by the Sufis and all other Muslims who believe in religion as a personal stance or a set of convictions; it separates faith from the state or officialdom. My concept of hudna and tahdi'a is based on the above distinction and interpretation of the two Islams."}

Meteorology officials in South Asia admit they have been slow to consider the role of fresh waters.

Monsoons account for 70% of the rainfall in India and neighbouring countries between June and September. But longer dry periods and heavy rainfall within a short space of time during monsoon season in recent years have caused concern in South Asia. And this is already being seen this year, with higher rainfall than normal in June - whereas July and August are predicted to have lower than normal rainfall. Some meteorologists based in the region believe the freshwater element could be a vital missing link. Major rivers such as the Ganges, Bramhaputra and Irrawaddy flow into the Bay of Bengal.

Yet, evolution of lactase persistence has divided the human species into those that can or cannot digest lactose in adulthood. Such a ubiquitous trait has differential effects on humanity. The literature is reviewed to explore how the divide affects lactose handling by lactase non persistent persons. There are two basic differences in digesters. Firstly, maldigesters consume less dairy foods, and secondly, excess lactose is digested by colonic microflora. Lactose intolerance in maldigesters may occur with random lactose ingestion. However, lactose intolerance without maldigestion tends to detract from gaining a clear understanding of the mechanisms of symptoms formation and leads to confusion with regards to dairy food consumption. The main consequence of intolerance is withholding dairy foods. However, regular dairy food consumption by lactase non persistent people could lead to colonic adaptation by the microbiome. This process may mimic a prebiotic effect and allows lactase non persistent people to consume more dairy foods enhancing a favorable microbiome. This process then could lead to alterations in outcome of diseases in response to dairy foods in lactose maldigesters. The evidence that lactose is a selective human prebiotic is reviewed and current links between dairy foods and some diseases are discussed within this context. Colonic adaptation has not been adequately studied, especially with modern microbiological techniques.1.

The producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. What follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. Lots of DVD extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. It must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. Later years would bring similar films such as, Singin' in the Rain(1952) & Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner's, The Comic(1969). What is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. We see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. One of the greatest in the silent era, Buster Keaton, who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! It is said that he had some input on his scenes as well.

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms."}

Handing over US-run jails has been a key demand of Afghan President Hamid Karzai ahead of Nato's withdrawal. Analysts say the issue has cast a shadow over negotiations on Nato's withdrawal of all of its combat forces by the end of 2014 and the long-term relationship with Afghanistan. Bagram prison, officially known as the Parwan Detention Centre, is located in one of the largest military bases for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan. It has been at the centre of a number of prisoner abuse allegations in recent years. Nato is also under intense pressure after days of protests and targeted killings across Afghanistan - over the inadvertent burning of Korans at Bagram - left at least 30 people dead. The US repeatedly apologised over the incident but that failed to quell public anger.

But the Silicon Glen phenomenon was important to replacing the jobs from old industries, which were dying as electronics arrived. The new manufacturers, often headquartered in the US, Japan and South Korea, helped Scotland's new towns establish themselves as economic hubs. They brought new, more efficient work practices, which benefited the wider economy. And they were a means for bringing many more women into the workforce. The priority then was for the Scottish Development Agency (predecessor of Scottish Enterprise) was to attract inward investment with large job numbers. The quality of the jobs didn't matter so much. Some firms brought higher-skilled jobs, with support services, research and development, so that when the manufacturing left, there was a valuable legacy - at IBM in Greenock, for instance, and NCR in Dundee.

She finished the manuscript in 1995, writing much of it in cafes in Edinburgh while her baby from her first marriage slept in a pram. After many rejections, the manuscript was eventually picked up by Bloomsbury. The first hardback print run, which came out on 26 June 1997, was just 500 copies. Then something magic happened. That first book - and the six that followed - went on to sell more than 450 million copies around the world. Here's a look at the many ways the Harry Potter phenomenon has cast a spell on the cultural landscape over two decades. Okay, so books were around for a long time before Harry Potter. But JK Rowling turned book consumption, especially for children, into something close to addiction. You want proof? The UK release of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in 1999 was timed at 3.45pm to prevent children in England and Wales from skipping school to get their copy. The later books got HUGE but it didn't stop kids devouring them. Grown-ups got hooked too, with the books being released in adult-friendly covers. The book releases themselves became headline news: when the fourth book Goblet of Fire came out in 2000, booksellers around the world got together to coordinate the first ever global midnight launch. When Rowling received an honorary degree at St Andrews University that same year, the Scottish institution said she had proved that children's books \"are still capable of capturing and enchanting an immense audience, irrespective of the competing attractions of television, Nintendo, Gameboy and Pokemon\". The Harry Potter books are credited with opening the way to a whole swathe load of young adult fantasy fiction. Lots of books were released in the hope they would be \"the next Harry Potter\", such as Artemis Fowl, The Spiderwick Chronicles and A Series of Unfortunate Events. Would we have had blockbuster series like Twilight and The Hunger Games novels had not Potter paved the way? And let's not forget fan fiction.

A report for the developers suggests some unexploded munitions could remain buried in the former quarry. But it said German nerve gas was removed and destroyed decades ago. The power company Snowdonia Pump Hydro (SPH) want to use the old Glyn Rhonwy quarry as the site of a 600 MWh pumped electricity storage facility. Those proposals are now being considered by the UK's Planning Inspectorate. However, opponents of the scheme in the area have concerns over possible contamination at the Glyn Rhonwy workings. The slate quarry was used as a secret munitions store during WW2, and later it was used to dispose of old and surplus bombs, bullets and grenades. Thousands of tonnes of weapons ended up in quarry pits there, prompting a massive RAF clean-up operation that only ended in the mid-1970s. The 'Concerned about Glyn Rhonwy' group said they believed that chemical weapons may have also been dumped or buried at the site.. A consultant's report confirmed that 70,000 German tabun nerve gas shells seized following WW2 were held at the Llanberis quarry for a short time. They were later moved to another facility near Caernarfon, and eventually dumped at sea.

In March Ofsted reported that the Wakeman was a good school, with a good capacity for sustained improvement. Last week the school also achieved its best ever GCSE results.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly."}

They drink him up, strangle him, and then toss him down a well.

As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 \u00b7 1017. Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes.

Others were left to do that. Nevertheless, Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg made it clear they were not lacking for performance. \"I'm paying attention, of course,\" said Rosberg, who described the car as \"quick\". \"We have strategists and they're doing calculations already, so more or less we already know where we are, with a band of errors. \"Would you like to know?

Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel left the test with the fastest time - a one minute 22.801 seconds lap set on the second day on the new ultra-soft tyre.

Succession for the Yuan dynasty, however, was an intractable problem, later causing much strife and internal struggle. This emerged as early as the end of Kublai's reign. Kublai originally named his eldest son, Zhenjin, as the Crown Prince, but he died before Kublai in 1285. Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother K\u00f6kejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Tem\u00fcr Khan, or Emperor Chengzong, from 1294 to 1307. Tem\u00fcr Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather. He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as Vietnam, which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades. However, the corruption in the Yuan dynasty began during the reign of Tem\u00fcr Khan."}

This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host.

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below)."}

This is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of \"cut and paste\" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy. The official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made. But its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: \"Chronically unstable and ungoverned\", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine. There has been some improvement. Piracy, which at its height cost $7bn (\u00c2\u00a35.4bn) a year, is much diminished, although there has been a recent resurgence. US drones, African Union troops, Western \"security advisers\" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will. A recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament. Somalia is in a \"pre-famine\" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died.

One boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. \"His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition,\" says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. \"He will never recover.\" According to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening.

Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources, but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions, drives people to poverty, constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility, and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation, unrest and conflict. Policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth."}

Ch Insp Steve Morrey said:  \"Despite repeated requests for information made to Twitter regarding a number of other users we wanted to speak to in connection with this matter, Twitter have not supplied it.... therefore all lines of inquiry have been exhausted.\" In response, Mr Collymore, who now works as a pundit for radio station TalkSport, tweeted: \"Cannock and Staffordshire Police have been exceptional. \"It's Twitter refusing to give info. Twitter, beyond UK law. For now.\" But he later tweeted part of a conversation between himself and Twitter which said after initial communications, Staffordshire Police stopped responding to requests for information by the social media giant.

These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects."}

And two years earlier, Kenneth Cole, boss of the eponymous clothing and accessories brand, tweeted this howler during the Egyptian revolution: \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now online...\" The twitterstorm that followed forced him to make a swift apology in which he admitted that his tweet had been \"insensitive\" and \"absolutely inappropriate\". So perhaps it is no wonder only 10% of the chief executives running the world's 50 largest companies regularly tweet, according to a survey by marketing consultancy Weber Shandwick. The risk of contracting foot-in-mouth disease seems just too high for many. But Robert Glaesener, boss of Twitter analytics firm Talkwalker, believes the fact that most of them are aged 50-to-60 has more to do with it - they're simply too old to understand social media fully, he says. Even tweeting extrovert Sir Richard Branson, who has more than six million followers and epitomises the consumer-friendly, approachable boss, is prone to the occasional gaffe. His tweet on the day of the fatal Virgin Galactic crash last year began: \"Space is hard - but worth it.\" This was considered insensitive by some commentators and led others to question the legitimacy of his space tourism mission. \"There is a real danger that something that is well meant can end up creating cynicism on social media,\" warns Mr Glaesener. \"While most of the responses to that tweet were positive and supportive, there were also negative responses with people questioning his motives.\" But leaving Twitter campaigns to your corporate PR team sometimes isn't any better. When British Gas decided to hold a Twitter Q&A with customers on the same day it announced price rises of 9.2%, it led to a barrage of abuse hurled at the then customer services director, Bert Pijls.

Then the new government (and its media apologists) segued effortlessly and without explanation into arguing that the deficit wasn't a life-and-death issue after all. In fact, the budget couldn't be brought back quickly into balance without risking undermining the still soft recovery.All the information needed to make that judgment was publicly available by the beginning of 2013.

Mrs Hunter Gordon made hundreds of the nappies using a sewing machine at her kitchen table, supplying friends with the product and constantly modifying the design. Her husband, Major Pat Hunter Gordon, was also pressed into helping make the nappies when he returned from fighting in Borneo. Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Mrs Hunter Gordon said she had found washing nappies much too laborious and so began searching for disposables. \"I thought you must be able to buy them - but you couldn't, not anywhere,\" she said. \"It seemed extraordinary that it hadn't been done before. I thought, it's easy, I'll make them. But it wasn't easy. It was quite tricky. \"Everybody who saw them said, Valerie, please would you make one for me? And so I ended up by making about over 600 of them. \"I spent my time sitting at my mother's sewing machine, making these wretched things.\" Paddis replaced absorbent cotton towelling nappies, which had to be washed after each use. \"Everybody wanted to stop washing nappies.

The SV3 incorporates the latest advancements in energy harvesting technology, providing the ability to use both wave and solar energy for forward propulsion, the company said. The systems could help scientists explore portions of the world's oceans in conditions that previously were too challenging or costly to operate.Whereas the original Wave Glider could take sensor readings, the SV3 can be packed with enough onboard hardware to process data at sea. The results are transmitted back to its headquarters, saving bandwidth and time. \"It's basically a floating server rack at sea,\" said Bill Vass, CEO of Liquid Robotics.The SV3 also improves on how the craft gets around. The original robot could harness ocean waves for propulsion, so it never had to stop for fuel. But it was at times stymied by environmental conditions such as calm seas and strong currents pushing it off-course. The SV3s can have a backup thruster system installed which recharges from solar panels, providing extra speed, power and directional control when needed.Vass said the SV3s run on open Linux with Java, and have enough space"}

A blog by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial condemned the theft. \"While we do not know who is behind the theft of the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an offensive attack on the memory of the Holocaust,\" it said. Thousands of Jews, foreigners and other groups persecuted by the Nazis were later held at Dachau - initially built to house political prisoners. Many inmates were shot or gassed, with thousands others dying through disease or overwork. The camp is now a memorial, with hundreds of thousand of visitors each year from around the world. "}

That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law \u2013 something never done before.

Now, after eight increasingly successful years at Edgbaston, the last six of them as an automatic Bears first-team choice, the left-arm all-rounder could have another big decision to make. England or West Indies? \"I've been asked it a lot over the years,\" Barker told BBC Sport. \"Would I play for England or the West Indies?

But there is another option open to this Lancastrian son of a West Indian, whose godfather is the great Clive Lloyd. Could he really play for the Windies? \"I'd be open to it obviously,\" said Barker. \"But it would be a possible lifestyle change. I'd probably have to up and move. I couldn't just walk straight into the squad. You have to play so many games - and I'd have to perform in them too. \"I've no issue with not being selected by England. They might see me only as being a good county player and that's fine as I never even thought I'd do that in the first place. \"I'm proud to have achieved what I have. I don't want to look back thinking I could have done more. If I was to be given some sort of recognition internationally, it would have most likely happened by now. But. if that means I finish without ever playing at international level, I'd still be happy.\" Keith Barker Sr played first-class cricket for his native British Guiana, in the early 1960s, sharing the same team as such West Indies greats Lloyd, Lance Gibbs, Basil Butcher, Clyde Walcott and Rohan Kanhai. And, as a Lancastrian son of a West Indian, Keith Barker Jr he admits he was born to play cricket. \"I'm told I had a cricket bat in my hand before I could walk,\" said Manchester-born Barker, who grew up in Accrington, while his father was professional at various nearby Lancashire League clubs, including Great Harwood, Enfield and Rishton. \"I was always playing with my brothers,\" he recalls. \"We used to play on the driveway when it was sunny, with a skateboard for stumps, leaned up against the garage door. \"I played my first Under-13s game at the age of six when one lad didn't turn up, I trialled with Lancashire Under-11s at eight and, at one point, we had all four of us brothers playing for Enfield, "}

And then there are unusual customs that have only recently evolved, but have become as much a part of the election as campaign adverts. We examine 10 of the lesser-spotted things about American presidential politics - and about this campaign. While there are no longer any statewide laws barring the sale of alcohol on election day, some local cities and counties continue the practice in states such as Indiana. In fact, 18 cities and seven counties in the Hoosier State have local ordinances banning the sale of alcohol on 8 November. The practice would be considered un-American by George Washington's standards. While running for the House of Burgesses in 1758, the founding father famously spent his entire campaign budget of \u00c2\u00a350 on alcohol, plying voters with 160 gallons of liquor to drive turnout and win favour. President Washington opened a major whiskey distillery at his estate in Mount Vernon, Virginia, in 1797. By the time of his death in 1799, his distillery was one of the largest in the country. The US maintains the separation of church and state, but some states have attempted to circumvent the law by requiring candidates to at least believe in God. Texas bans religious tests as a qualification to hold office, but requires an official to \"acknowledge the existence of a Supreme Being\", according to its Constitution's Article-I Bill of Rights. Tennessee also upholds a similar law, banning any person who denies a supreme being from holding office in the state's civil department. Other states with similar laws include South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Maryland and Arkansas.

With practice, this is relatively easy.2) Maintaining no thoughts with a blank awareness. This is nearly impossible to do, even for an adept meditator.3) Letting imaginative experience play through our awareness with no emotional or ego driven interference. This is what I call the receptive imagination.This third mode of meditation lends itself to experiences that are projections of the self into mental or imaginal realms. These projections vary across a scale ranging from subconsciously driven experience, much like dreaming, to perceptions that are flowing in from outside the mind and body, such as out-of-body experiences or remote viewing.Meditative projection can be achieved by using chi energy circulation to reach an elevated state of consciousness [fountain meditation], then concentrating awareness within the receptive imagination. Where awareness goes in the imaginal depends on the intention set at the beginning of the meditation."}

First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D."}

Consumption is still very, very limited. Even in Madagascar, people don't use the pepper extensively. Mr Rakotondravelo, however, thinks it has potential. He is not the only one.

(Reuters) - The owners of a Portland-area bakery who refused on religious grounds to bake a wedding cake for a lesbian couple have paid about $144,000 in damages despite their ongoing appeal of the discrimination case, a state official said on Tuesday.The damages were ordered after Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of the Sweet Cakes by Melissa bakery, refused to bake a cake in 2013 when Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer were planning their nuptials.Aaron Klein handed the state a check for nearly $137,000 on Monday, Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries spokesman Charlie Burr said. The payment was first reported by the Oregonian newspaper late on Monday.The money was added to $7,000 received from the Kleins earlier this month through private collection efforts spearheaded by the state's Department of Justice, Burr told Reuters.After the owners' refusal to bake the cake, the state bureau found they had violated anti-discrimination laws because their shop is not a registered religious institution. It ordered them to pay the Bowman-Cryers $135,000 in damages.The Kleins appealed the ruling and had refused to pay the damages, citing financial hardship.Burr said the shop owners subsequently raised about $500,000 from supporters via an online crowdfunding effort.The damages had been accruing interest since the damages were ordered due in July. \"We were in touch with their attorneys in giving precise amounts in what they needed to pay to cease collection efforts,\" Burr said.The Kleins'"}

She is desperate to achieve a grade C in maths, after missing out by just a few marks on more than one occasion. In 2013, the government introduced a policy that said students in England who fail to get a grade C or above in GCSE maths or English should carry on studying the subject, or subjects, until the age of 18, with the aim of achieving this mark. It means hundreds of thousands of pupils like Georgina - who is also studying for A-levels in drama and health and social care - are taking resits up to twice an academic year. Figures from the Department for Education show that 77.3% of students in England do not attain a C grade in English or maths when they resit the exam post-16. \"You've got to keep going because I need it to get a job and get into university,\" she says. \"I'm so close and it's so frustrating.\" At Tolworth Girls' School's sixth form, in Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, Georgina and her friends are taught resit classes, but the teachers' busy timetables mean they are limited to just a couple of hours per week. Chloe Gatt, the school's head of English, says budget strains mean it is difficult to find enough staff to cover those teaching the extra lessons. Were she not teaching the resit class, she would probably be with her Year 7 or 8 pupils, or her A-level students, she says.

Even before the latest influx, Turkey was struggling to cope with more than a million Syrian refugees who have crossed into its territory since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began more than three years ago. Carol Batchelor, the UNHCR's envoy in Turkey, told the BBC that such high numbers of refugees would place a strain on any host community. The sheer number of refugees would overwhelm any country. Added to that, they are Kurds from Syria, many of them deeply hostile to Turkey. For 30 years, Turkish forces fought Kurdish rebels in a civil war that killed 40,000 people. The fact that Turkey is accepting tens of thousands of Kurds is a sign of how allegiances are being forced to change with the onslaught of Islamic State.

McManus was also convicted of attempting to murder her partner, Norman Busby, 86, and two robbery-related stabbings.

Staff from the EU make up nearly a quarter of all jobs in the sector. Immigration is set to be one of the most controversial issues to be settled during the Brexit negotiations. The hospitality industry represents 3 million workers and about a tenth of the UK's economic wealth. In the first major business intervention since the triggering of Article 50, a report by KPMG for the BHA says that it will take 10 years to reduce the need for EU workers by training British staff, targeting older workers and encouraging younger people to take jobs in the sector. But with the UK economy approaching full employment, the report says that there are no easy pools of labour to exploit and that EU nationals will still make up a large part of the workforce. The KPMG study - which has been sent to Number 10 - says that 75% of waiting staff in the UK, 37% of house-keeping staff and a quarter of all chefs are from the EU. Last month the sandwich and coffee chain Pret a Manger revealed that only one in fifty of its applicants was British and 65% of its workforce were EU nationals. The company's head of human resources, Andrea Wareham, said it would be virtually impossible to recruit enough staff if heavy controls were applied to EU nationals wanting to work in the UK. \"It is clear that hospitality and tourism face major problems in recruitment if there is any major cut in the number of workers allowed to enter from the EU,\" Ufi Ibrahim, head of the BHA, said. \"We want to avoid there being any cliff edge but the government must be aware that in the medium to long term we will still need considerable numbers of EU"}

Prebiotics and probiotics are briefly discussed to illustrate their potential in affecting various diseases. We then argue that lactose qualifies as a prebiotic. We finally discuss the variable effects of dairy foods (DFs) on different diseases and argue that the possible prebiotic lactose effect in LNP populations are not adequately explored. Colonic adaptation in LNP persons may introduce a confounder if LP/LNP is ignored, because the mechanisms of DF effects may be different in some diseases in the two populations.

Once the interstate was completed, Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile, in the past few years, the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing.<br /><br />It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film \"\"Rollercoaster\"\".

However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.

She meets two men on her journey: a former college football hero who--after an accident during a game--has been left with permanent brain damage, and a sexy, strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life.

Scotland's attacking game is improving, no question. Their ability to make things happen out of nothing is on the rise and the arrival of Huw Jones has been a boost. That Scottish midfield is showing serious depth now - Jones, Alex Dunbar, Duncan Taylor, Mark Bennett, Peter Horne, Matt Scott. That's as good as it has been, possibly forever. The Australia game showed that Scotland have the artillery to find space and the wit to score against the elite. It was the one that got away after the one that got away in the World Cup last year, but if they can learn the lessons then, come the Six Nations, it will have been worth the angst. Against Argentina, in a brutal and second-rate game, Scotland dug it out, which says something about their mental strength. On Saturday against the Georgians, they put the game to bed in little over 30 minutes after a terrible beginning. It is easy to see Scotland's upside, but just as easy to see their weaknesses. Their front-liners are strong and many of them have their best years ahead of them, but this is a paper-thin squad in terms of true Six Nations class. There has been added depth this autumn in the front row. Alasdair Dickinson and WP Nel remain the first-choice props but Allan Dell and Zander Fagerson have done themselves a power of good. Hamish Watson has been terrific and even if John Hardie was fit and well, Watson would surely be deemed the starting open-side flanker now. Magnus Bradbury was given a deserved crack against Argentina and did well in parts. Coach Vern Cotter spoke about the"}

The inquest was told that in January 2005, new disciplinary rules, known as AGAI 67, were brought in by the Army. Coroner Alan Large said using physical drills as a punishment was not within the AGAI rules, but Cpl Edwards said he was not aware of that at the time.

Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting \"\"f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!\"\"<br /><br />Well anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film, \"\"You've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family.\"\" Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in God's name can he tell the story for them!?

It's a word that gets bandied around so much, and so often, it runs the risk of becoming meaningless. It's worth remembering, though, that only 12 months ago the #OscarsSoWhite controversy was all Hollywood was talking about. Two years of all-white line-ups in the four acting categories stung the Academy into taking concerted measures to broaden its membership's make-up. Viewed in that light, this year's list of award winners makes for much more encouraging reading. Yet it wasn't just the winners who reflected the \"identity rainbow\" Jodie Foster spoke about at a pre-Oscars rally. From Loving's Ruth Negga to Moonlight's Naomie Harris to Lion's Dev Patel, the losers were a pretty diverse bunch too.

She said: \"Ruth Davidson says I talk about nothing else, the truth is she talks so much about independence that I can't get a word in edgeways about it. \"Ruth Davidson is using independence as a smokescreen in this campaign because she knows the Tory record and Tory policies are toxic.\" Ms Dugdale warned the opinion polls were suggesting that the Conservatives \"will be back and they will be more destructive than ever before\" after the election. She added: \"So who do you want to stand up to the Tories? Labour MPs who understand your life, because they've lived, or SNP MPs who will use every bit of Tory cruelty to exploit the case for independence.\" Mr Rennie said the SNP's focus was \"always independence\", adding: \"It took 44 days for Nicola Sturgeon to publish her Bill on another independence referendum.

Wasps, who started the day two points behind Pool Two leaders Connacht, are now three points ahead of them after the bonus-point win. They have scored a total of 17 tries in their first three European games. Australia international Beale agreed to join Wasps on 13 May, but suffered a serious knee injury less than a day later which delayed his debut for his new club. However, the 27-year-old made up for lost time as he produced an outstanding display in an incident-packed debut. He spun out of a collision with Stacey Ili before stretching over the line to score the game's first points before being shown a yellow card for a high tackle on Niyi Adeolokun. Beale was also heavily involved in the build-up to tries from Launchbury and Bassett. Connacht had beaten Toulouse and hammered Zebre in their opening two games in this season's competition. Yet they failed to take the lead at any time in what was a physical and sometimes breathless game. Marmion spotted a considerable gap around the forward fringes and sprinted clear to score an opportunist try before replacement Parata's touchdown after a clever interception.

From the age of five, I was playing football in the back garden with my brothers. When I was growing up, there wasn't the opportunity for a girl like me to play football for a team or a club. Being from a South Asian background, me playing football was seen as taboo, especially within the Asian community. Muslim girls were encouraged to play sports but not alongside boys and it was preferred that we played indoor sports like netball or badminton which took place in enclosed environments. When I played football, I wore shorts - even that was frowned upon and raised eyebrows. I played alongside other girls at school but I enjoyed playing the game with boys. There was a lack of opportunity and so much negativity, I gave up playing at the age of 14. I was heartbroken and angry at the same time. I felt like an outsider within my own community. I never lost my passion for the game though - I would still take my ball down the park for a kickabout and I always watched football on TV. But"}

In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa.

The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled \"\"The Number 23\"\" is an awful"}

Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense.

A crowd of 17,056 turned up for the Easter Road party, ending a period of three seasons in the second tier for the Edinburgh club. Having drawn four of their past five games, there was no sign of any malaise as the hosts started in whirlwind fashion, with John McGinn and Martin Boyle having early chances. But the Dumfries side showed they were not simply making up the numbers as Dominic Thomas fired just wide from 18 yards. The breakthrough came on 13 minutes as McGinn floated a free-kick to the back post, where McGregor sent a header arcing over the outstretched arms of Lee Robinson and into the net. It was the centre-half's first goal of the season and the huge home support roared their approval. They were then infuriated by referee Barry Cook, who called back play when Cummings was clean through on goal. Queens midfielder John Rankin was booked for a challenge on Andrew Shinnie but, rather than playing advantage, Cook blew his whistle. The visitors almost drew level when former Hibee Stephen Dobbie got on the end of a mishit shot by Thomson, but Ofir Marciano pulled off a magnificent stop. Robinson then denied the home side a second with a wonderful save from a Boyle shot but, moments later, Lennon's side doubled their advantage.

Speaking publicly about the investigation for the first time, Mr Boehmermann told Germany's Die Zeit newspaper: \"The chancellor must not wobble when it's a matter of freedom of opinion. \"But instead, she filleted me, served me for tea to a highly strung despot and made me into a German Ai Weiwei.\" Ai Weiwei is a Chinese dissident artist who was prosecuted and imprisoned by his home country. Boehmermann, considered Germany's most incisive satirist, read the obscene poem on his Neo Magazin Royale programme, making clear that it included material that broke German laws on free speech. Section 103 of the criminal code bans insulting representatives or organs belonging to foreign states. In particular, the poem made references to sex with goats and sheep, as well as repression of Turkish minorities. Reports said that Mr Erdogan demanded Germany press charges against the comedian. German law forbids citizens to insult foreign leaders, but the decision to investigate Mr Boehmermann has proved highly controversial. Prosecutors dealing with the case say they are unsure when a decision will be made on whether to pursue it.

Or maybe, \"Do you have any blue shirts in my size?\" Sometimes they'll ask you things too, with something like: \"Do you want to hear today's top stories?\" Right now the conversations will be structured - with Messenger bots suggesting things you can say. But the goal is natural conversation, and it could be a huge step. If what Facebook has promised today at its F8 developer conference comes to pass, the effect on our everyday lives could be enormous. It could be, according to Facebook's head of messaging David Marcus, a return to more personal interactions. \"Before the internet era, everything was conversational,\" he told the BBC. \"But then we traded conversations for scale.\" One of the bots being launched on the service today will be from Spring, an artificially intelligent concierge service. \"Spring is actually going to build an experience where everything is automated except customer service,\" Mr Marcus explained. \"It's bot for 99.9%, but then if you have a problem, a human can actually jump in and sort out your problem. \"That's the best of both worlds.\" There are obvious concerns to all this, and I'll get to those in a second, but first here's how it will work. Messenger Platform, as Facebook calls it, is the firm's latest application programming interface (API). An API is a way for companies like Facebook to give external developers the access and know-how to make things on their platforms. It's a big opportunity - the company's first API, which allowed anyone to create apps on Facebook, led to the birth of multi-billion dollar companies including Farmville creator, Zynga.

The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution, allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable. The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced, but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives."}

Deutscher, who is homeschooled in Dorking, south of London, participated in the performance. She played musical interludes on the piano and at one point accompanied Cinderella on the violin. Some have compared the girl's musical talent with that of Vienna's most famous child prodigy, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who thrilled Europe with his operas and instrumental works in the late 18th Century. German media describe her as a \"Wunderkind\". Deutscher told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"quite a few of my melodies and themes for this opera came while I was skipping\". \"I take my skipping rope to the rehearsals and skip with it in the breaks,\" she said. When asked about her creativity, Deutscher said: \"I don't go to school, I learn at home, I'm home-schooled. I read lots of books, I love reading... I read biographies about scientists and composers.\" There was no giant pumpkin in her opera, nor did the prince find Cinderella's lost shoe, like in more famous versions of the tale.

Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields."}

The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were, despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie's character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). The movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington's. Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off.

During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence.

The report from GlobalWebIndex said that despite VPNs being thought of as \"fairly niche tools which are the preserve of the tech-savviest individuals\", around 25% of internet users worldwide now use them, primarily to access better entertainment content.

In terms of numbers, this was not the biggest hack of recent years by a long shot. But it had a huge impact on peoples' lives. Some relationships ended. Other people lived in fear that their significant others - who might never have heard of the website before the breach - would find out they were looking for the chance to have affairs. The hack also damaged the firm's most valuable commodity - trust in its website. Ashley Madison had assured users they were entering an \"anonymous\" website, but their details were made public. It had even offered a \"delete\" service that turned out not to work. People who had paid $19 (\u00c2\u00a315) for a \"full delete\" found their names and email addresses were still on the searchable database. Two women explain how the Ashley Madison hack changed their lives But there were extremely serious consequences worldwide. Police in Canada said two people's suicides were linked to the data leakage. And activists warned that being publicly outed put many LGBT people at risk worldwide, especially in places where they might be beaten up or worse. The UK phone and broadband provider TalkTalk suffered three data breaches in the course of a year.

No wonder then that Nicolas Sarkozy stamped his personality on France's relations abroad So if Socialist candidate Francois Hollande - consistently ahead in the opinion polls - were to win on Sunday, how would French foreign policy change? It is a question I put to veteran French analyst Dominique Moisi. Mr Hollande's style would, he told me, be very different \"not least because his international experience is very limited\". President Sarkozy was strong on high-profile diplomacy and eager to seize upon events to propel France into a driving seat. In the summer of 2008 he took the helm of EU efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Georgia and French warplanes were first into action against Libyan government troops in March 2011. In both cases France was by no means acting alone but Nicolas Sarkozy sought to leverage its interventions to bolster French foreign policy goals. Mr Hollande is not Mr Sarkozy. Indeed it is the current French president's personality, as much as anything else, that was rejected by many voters at the first ballot. So Dominique Moisi believes that the style of French foreign policy would change under Mr Hollande but he adds one important caveat: Mr Hollande could change while in office. Mr Hollande's chief challenge would be how to deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and his other European partners, says Francois Heisbourg, a strategic adviser at the Paris-based think-tank FRS. Much has been made of Francois Hollande's desire to promote growth and his unhappiness with the European Union's whole approach to austerity, championed by Mrs Merkel. Indeed the German chancellor has made no secret of her preference for the re-election of Nicolas Sarkozy. But Mr Sarkozy's policy of sticking to the Germans and doing what they want has"}

Former Charlton boss Powell, who served as Nigel Pearson's number two at Derby, has taken over after the manager was suspended pending a club investigation into his behaviour. He saw his side almost go behind in first-half stoppage time as Yann Kermogant's powerful header was well saved by Scott Carson. But Vydra scored for the first time since moving to Derby for a club-record fee at the end of August, flicking home after Christie's poor free-kick. Had Vydra converted his header 12 minutes later, Powell would have been celebrating a perfect record in charge of Derby, having won at Cardiff on Tuesday.

Both must now get themselves into their final positions. Noteworthy is the fact that ViaSat-2 and 172B will be using electric engines to do this. These work by accelerating and expelling ions at high speed. The process provides less thrust than a standard chemical engine, but saves substantially on propellant mass. That saving can be traded to get either a lower-priced launch ticket, or to pack even greater capacity into the satellite's communications payload for no additional weight.

The movie's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making Hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist.

So is the top four now a closed shop, especially given United manager Louis van Gaal's admission that the Europa League is their best chance of reaching the Champions League? And what shape are the top four currently in? Form: The Foxes were seconds away from a point that would have seemed like a victory at Arsenal - achieved with a numerical disadvantage after Danny Simpson's sending off and would have completed a haul of four points from away fixtures against the Gunners and Manchester City. Instead, Danny Welbeck's late winner changed the landscape but, as Foxes manager Claudio Ranieri pointed out, if they had said before they would pick up two points from those games that would have looked good. We have seen the brilliance of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, but Sunday was a day that demonstrated they can dig in and have character and guts all over the field, with midfield man N'Golo Kante and keeper Kasper Schmeichel outstanding. Six points from a home game against Liverpool and these two tough away fixtures is an excellent tally and, despite the loss, there was nothing at Arsenal to suggest they cannot recover. Momentum: Still plenty and when they face Norwich City next at the King Power Stadium in front of their own fervent fans, you would back them to get back to winning ways. Fixtures are also acceptable too - they have already played their six fixtures against the other teams in the top four and have a return of eight points. Momentum still intact and nothing to fear in the weeks ahead. X Factor? X Factors for and against here. Who knows how Leicester will react to a painful defeat, or the growing recognition that they can no longer hide beneath the radar or play down their chances? And of course there is always the worry of injuries (longer-term at least) to Vardy, Mahrez or Kante. These are the unknowns - but even in defeat"}

It is estimated that domestic energy use accounts for more than a quarter of the nation's CO2 emissions. The report  was commissioned by the government and the Energy Saving Trust to unearth the nation's energy habits. \"This standby power is double what we have assumed it to be in past models and policy assumptions,\" explained Paula Owen, the report's lead author. \"Before, we have always gone with an 8% figure so it was quite a shock.\" Within in this study, Dr Owen explained, standby had a slightly wider remit from its traditional perception of the red lights on TVs and videos. \"When we talk about standby in this context, we are talking about things that are on standby and things [that] are idle, rather than [doing] what they are primarily designed to do,\" she said. The modern home contained an average of 41 devices, compared with a dozen or so in the 1970s. The UK year-long study, commissioned by EST, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Department for Energy and Climate Change (Decc), involved more than 250 households.

Raikkonen, who drove well from 14th on the grid, collided with Verstappen's Red Bull in a lively fight in the closing laps but was unable to pass the Dutchman.

Mr Ebrahimi's sisters, Mojgan Kahayatian and Manisha Moores, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report showed \"how terrible a life he had during those last few years\". Mr Ebrahimi was killed by his neighbour Lee James in Brislington in July 2013. Three days before his death, police arrested Mr Ebrahimi following complaints he had taken pictures of children near his home. However nothing suspicious was found and he was released without charge. These false allegations led to what Mr Justice Simon called during James's sentencing \"a vigilante crime\" and \"an act of murderous injustice\". During the fatal attack, James repeatedly stamped on the victim's head shouting \"have some of that\". Evidence gathered by the IPCC uncovered \"poor responses\" by police for at least seven years before the murder and repeated failures to protect him or record crimes against him. In 73 of the calls Mr Ebrahimi made between 2007 and 2013, he reported incidents of racial abuse, criminal damage and threats to kill. But police failed to record crimes on at least 40 occasions, the watchdog said. The report also found there was \"consistent systematic failure\" by call handlers, who breached standards on recording crimes, identifying hate offences and repeat victims.

Wigan, 22nd in the Championship, had stood up well to the 12-time winners before conceding three goals in 24 second-half minutes. United, who made nine changes to the side that faced Hull in the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final on Thursday, sent on substitute keeper Joel Pereira, 20, and defender Axel Tuanzebe, 19, for their debuts. This was an opportunity for a number of United players to prove a point to Mourinho and, after a slow start, they responded with a professional performance as they swept aside the 2013 winners. Schweinsteiger made his first start since 9 January 2016, Luke Shaw started for the first time since 30 November and Martial had a chance to show he has a long-term future at Old Trafford.

Wigan, managed by former United reserve boss Warren Joyce, started well at Old Trafford with Callum Connelly and Max Power forcing early saves from Sergio Romero.

Romero denied David Perkins before Smalling took advantage of poor marking to meet Martial's cross and make it 2-0.

It is the first official trip all four of the family have been on together. By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Those who chronicle the lives of the Cambridges now know that balloons are the way to a 16-month-old princess's heart and Charlotte's first public utterance was to use the word \"pop\". And for toddler George there was much fun to be had squirting bubbles at his father - even if he is a future king of Canada and the UK. Considerable column inches are generated from such offerings. The power of the images is considerable. The children personify the future of the Canadian monarchy in a country that may, one day, chose a different path. There's no sign, at the moment, of that being the desire of the majority of Canadians. George and Charlotte, on display, will not become an everyday occurrence.

For those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here.

A jury found the former nurse guilty of homicide by child abuse the day before and she could have faced up to life behind bars.Her lawyer said she will appeal and it's likely the case will be tied up for years to come.

With no needle marks on the child's body, authorities decided the drugs must have gotten into the infant through her mother's milk, prosecutor Barry Barnette said.A review of her medical records showed Greene carefully hid her pregnancy from her primary doctor.

The firms were quite right to be upset, the Supreme Court agreed, but then it got more complicated. The court hit a stumbling block over the amount of money the firms deserved in damages. The issue was that the judges couldn't determine precisely how valuable design was when compared with everything else that goes into making a nice carpet. A lovely design on a poor quality rug wouldn't sell, after all. And so it meant the companies got just six cents each. Which, even back then, was pitiful. Nominal damages. This caught the eye of Connecticut senator Orville Platt who, pressured by worried carpet makers, lobbied Congress to amend the Patent Act to make sure design patents were given more weight. By 1887, those changes were written into law.\u00a0 Senator Platt was looking to protect the interests of a thriving local industry - and he certainly achieved that.\u00a0 But he also put in place the framework that means, 129 years on, Samsung and Apple find themselves arguing over the very same principle.\u00a0 In 2011 Apple accused Samsung of being the Dobson brothers of the smartphone world, pinching three bits of iPhone design and using them in several Samsung devices.

Publishing Ofsted's annual report, Sir Michael warned of a growing north-south divide in standards in secondary schools. But he raised particular concerns about Bradford, where he said schools were in the lowest-achieving 10 authorities at both primary and secondary level. And he warned that schools in the city \"remain mired in mediocrity, failing generation after generation with depressing regularity\". Of the 100,000 pupils in Bradford's schools, he said 40,000 were in schools rated as \"less than good\" and 8,000 of these were in schools labelled as \"inadequate\". The Ofsted chief is calling for a commissioner to run education in the city. In the wake of the Trojan Horse controversy a commissioner was created to oversee education in Birmingham. Sir Michael warned of the risks of a weak education system. \"If children are poorly educated, they don't go to university, they don't get apprenticeships, they don't get jobs. \"Educational underperformance leads directly to social alienation,\" said Sir Michael.

Members of Israel's Ethiopian community, who account for about 130,000 of the country's eight million population, called for the commissioner to be sacked. Last year, thousands took to the streets to protest against alleged police abuses after a video emerged showing two officers beating an Ethiopian-Israeli soldier.

Research had also shown that young people in general were more involved in crime and that \"when the two come together, there's a situation in which a given community is more involved than others in crime, statistically speaking\", he added. The commissioner said this had been the case \"in all the waves of immigration\" to Israel, and \"also with regard to [Israeli] Arabs or [Palestinians in] East Jerusalem\". \"When a police officer comes across a suspicious person, his brain suspects him more than if he were someone else.

But Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers. Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics The Globe's site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse. Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself. Farah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources. The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\". But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences. \"We're not interested in re-enactment,\" she says. But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre? It was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames. It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight. The Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light. And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles. Light and "}

Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the 'bends') are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O 2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment."}

I hadn't been playing for a year. \"I wasn't fit. I wasn't sharp. So I needed to make sure I pushed myself in training. The Chelsea girls in training were amazing. \"It's been tough mentally, really tough.

He applied pressure to the entry wound to staunch the bleeding, pulling her on to his lap so she would not choke on her own blood. Paramedics then took her to a nearby hospital where trauma surgeon Peter Rhee, a former military doctor who served in Afghanistan, and his team worked with impressive efficiency. Ms Giffords was in the operating theatre about 38 minutes after she was shot. The bullet entered at the back of her skull and exited at the front, travelling through the left side of her brain - which controls speech among other things. Dr Rhee told reporters that Ms Giffords was fortunate that the bullet had stayed on one side and had not hit areas of the brain that are almost always fatal. Surgeons also did not have to remove much dead brain tissue, another positive sign. Bone fragments can often travel through the brain with the bullet, causing additional bleeding and damage.

'Benefits' offered by Comcast don't require merger approvalAs I wrote yesterday, Comcast made a decently convincing argument for why its merger with TWC should be approved, as long as you don't skim beneath the surface. The company's post-merger plans include an expanded low-income high-speed Internet service tier, the quick build-out of a national Wi-Fi network, no immediate change to the level of competition, and a superior set of consumer services.But sub-committee chair Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) kind of derailed much of that argument with a simple question: \"So will the benefits Comcast is offering happen even if the merger isn't approved?\"Comcast EVP David Cohen then admitted that many of those \"benefits\" were initiatives that do not depend on the merger going through. This is at least true of the national Wi-Fi network, the low-income Internet Essentials service, and improvements to current TWC subscribers' regular services (which were already in the works by TWC).2.

The modifications to power lines are taking place in areas where the birds have been known to nest or hunt for fishing. It involves moving the wires further apart, fitting rings on the lines to deter birds and making it harder for them to perch on transformer boxes which supply homes. Liam O'Sullivan from Scottish Power said: \"The death of the osprey in May was the first fatality that I can ever recall in our north Wales district. \"We wanted to act quickly to help to prevent any future incidents.\" Hear more on Country Focus, BBC Radio Wales, Sunday 18 October, 07:00 BST.

His son, Kim Jong-il rarely spoke in public. In addition to Mr Kim's televised address, new year's messages were issued in the form of a joint editorial by North Korea's three main newspapers.

By Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Seoul After a year of rocket launches and international isolation, the new year speech seemed to refocus North Korea's sights on the economy. There were the usual tributes to military strength, but less open hostility than in some previous speeches.   Instead the focus was a call by the North Korean leader for the country to become \"an economic giant\".

The Soviets were forced to withdraw, largely defeated, in 1989. They left a devastated country behind. A decade of fighting had left an estimated one million Afghans and 15,000 Soviet troops dead.

Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania. Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor. However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease.

The Daily Planet crew has known Jon his entire life.Action Comics #977 and #978 will delve a bit more deeply into that timeline, so readers have a common understanding about Superman's past.Dan Jurgens, Doug Mahnke,"}

After the statement has been delivered, the leaders of the opposition parties and other MSPs question the First Minister on issues related to the substance of the statement."}

A number of New Amsterdam's families were of Huguenot origin, often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century. In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'\u00c9glise fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 la Nouvelle-Amsterdam (the French church in New Amsterdam). This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit, part of the Episcopal (Anglican) communion, and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world.

It is a collection of the teachings of the Buddha expressed in clear, pithy verses. These verses were culled from various discourses given by the Buddha in the course of forty-five years of his teaching, as he travelled in the valley of the Ganges (Ganga) and the sub-mountain tract of the Himalayas. These verses are often terse, witty and convincing. Whenever similes are used, they are those that are easily understood even by a child, e.g., the cart's wheel, a man's shadow, a deep pool, flowers. Through these verses, the Buddha exhorts one to achieve that greatest of all conquests, the conquest of self; to escape from the evils of passion, hatred and ignorance; and to strive hard to attain freedom from craving and freedom from the round of rebirths. Each verse contains a truth (dhamma), an exhortation, a piece of advice.Dhammapada VersesDhammapada verses are often quoted by many in many countries of the world and the book has been translated into many languages. One of the earliest translations into English was made by Max Muller in 1870. Other translations that followed are those by F.L. Woodward in 1921, by Wagismara and Saunders in 1920, and by A.L.

Louise de Coligny, daughter of the murdered Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, married William the Silent, leader of the Dutch (Calvinist) revolt against Spanish (Catholic) rule. As both spoke French in daily life, their court church in the Prinsenhof in Delft held services in French. The practice has continued to the present day. The Prinsenhof is one of the 14 active Walloon churches of the Dutch Reformed Church. The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies. They settled at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and New Netherland in North America."}

In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield.

I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted.

I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.<br /><br />It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealed<br /><br />I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic.

It showed nearly three-quarters (72%) of survivors said they felt \"very\" or \"fairly welcome\" when they arrived in Britain. About half (52%) said they waited more than 20 years before talking about their experiences. Most said they did so to help more people understand what happened. Holocaust survivor, Joan Salter, was a three-month-old baby when Belgium was invaded by the Nazis. Her father was deported and her mother imprisoned. In 1943, Ms Salter was put on a boat by the Red Cross and sent to live with a foster family in the United States. She was reunited with her parents in London two years after World War Two had ended. \"It was anything but a fairytale ending though - both my parents were severely traumatised by what they'd experienced, broken in health, spirit and mind. \"Everyone deals with these things in their own ways.

Ideology and Catholicism have a long history in this country, if not the world over. Examining how faith relates to socio- political shibboleths seems enjoined upon us in 2017. Please do keep all that in mind as you read.Vice President Mike Pence is slated to give the commencement address this year at Notre Dame. Typically, the president is asked to speak to the graduating students in the first year of his tenure. The practice seems to have begun with Eisenhower, though it only became consistent after Carter (Clinton seems to have been skipped). Forsaking President Trump was likely a strategic decision; the university didn't want a repeat of the anger directed at former-president Obama's commencement address and ex-VP Biden's receiving the Laetare Medal. Pence, considered the saner and more religious of our executive top dogs, likely presented himself as a safer choice.But is he? The furor over Obama and Biden mostly hinged on their support for abortion and same-sex marriage. The latter, a Catholic, had, in the eyes of many, practically excommunicated himself. All well and good enough: except, of course, that if such is your litmus test for a speaker, Mike Pence is an even worse candidate.Why? Some students have said that his presence will make them feel"}

Prices have dropped due to oversupply and weaker demand. On an underlying basis, profit for the third quarter was $1.8bn, down from $3bn a year earlier but higher than analysts' estimates of $1.2bn.

BP continued to rein in spending estimates for 2015, which it now expects to be about $19bn compared with the $24bn-$26bn forecast a year ago.

Leakey's extreme measures to tackle poachers, including sending helicopter gunships into the national park, have helped Kenya's elephant and rhino populations recover from the brink of disaster. He made international headlines in 1989, when a stockpile of 12 tonnes of ivory was burned in Nairobi National Park.

Gregg Phillips and crew say at least 3,000,000 votes were illegal. We must do better!\" Since taking office, the president and his staff, most notably press secretary Sean Spicer, have repeated claims of mass voter fraud and on Wednesday, Trump promised a \"major investigation\" in response. So where did this figure of three million illegal votes come from and who is Gregg Phillips? The man Phillips is a staunch conservative  who began his work in government by campaigning for Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice in the mid-1990s. He subsequently became head the Mississippi Department of Human Services, but resigned a year later over conflict-of-interest claims levelled against him. He next became the deputy commissioner for Texas' Health and Human Services, before leaving public life to found his own companies. Long-time Clarion-Ledger investigative reporter Jerry Mitchell says he is still known in political circles in Mississippi. \"When I found out he was the one who [tweeted] this I was like, 'You're kidding me,'\" says Mitchell. \"Gregg has always been great at spinning things.\" Phillips did not return a request for comment from BBC News. The claim Phillips is a board member of True the Vote, a conservative nonprofit that tracks voter fraud, and the owner of a technology company called AutoGov. One of his products, called VoteStand, is intended to help users \"quickly report suspected election illegalities as they happen\". The app lets people take photos of irregularities they see at polling places, and sends the report back to VoteStand. On 11 November, 2016, just days after the election, Phillips wrote on Twitter, \"Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million.

Machines are turned off, staff slip away and patients settle down as the hurly, burly of the week gives way to the weekend. In one respect there is nothing wrong with this. Much of the non-emergency side of a hospital's work (knee and hip replacements for example) stops or at the very least slows at weekends. But this is not really the issue. Nor is there any real suggestion - despite the rhetoric being used - that there is no activity taking place all. After all, there are parts of the hospital where there is little let up no matter what day it is.

Brimming with confidence and charisma, the surgeon was precisely the kind of man people trusted with their lives. His unwavering composure reassured many an anxious patient as they were wheeled into the operating theatre. He was, after all, the Heart of England NHS Trust's busiest surgeon, taking on the lion's share of operations in his department, as well as running busy private clinics in the West Midlands. Patients thought he was a \"wonderful doctor\", said Prof Philip Drew, a cancer surgeon who gave expert evidence for the prosecution. \"I've met Mr Paterson personally, and he's very warm, credible person, you wouldn't ever suspect he was capable of this sort of thing.\" Frances Perks was 35 when she met Paterson after a lump was found in her breast. She had recently lost her mother and sister to breast cancer, and the surgeon told her to have double mastectomy or risk \"full-blown cancer\". In the end, she opted to have one breast, her left, removed, and underwent eight other operations at Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull after Paterson said he kept finding \"sinister\" looking lumps. The truth was, that Mrs Perks, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, should never have had any of the procedures, let alone lose her breast. \"I feel hatred. Pure hatred. I did not think I could hate someone as much as I hate him.\" READ MORE: 'He played God with our bodies' But, as various investigations have now revealed, Paterson routinely lied to and manipulated patients, colleagues and his bosses while carrying out disfiguring, dangerous procedures. The true number of people he damaged is unknown. His trial at Nottingham Crown Court was the tip of the iceberg. How was he able to get away with it for so long?

It's always interesting to see the story from the 'other' side for a change. This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the North Africa campaign are send to Stalingrad, Russia, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being fought.<br /><br />It's interesting to see the other side of this battle, since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the 'villains'. In this movie those 'villains' are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you're fighting against. At first it's kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the German's are the evil villains. But of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care -and be interested in them.<br /><br />The way this story is told isn't however the best. It's hard to keep track of the story at times, as it jumps from the one sequence"}

It is not the first time Evans has spoken out against Bedene's switch, with the player previously saying - before the change of allegiance was confirmed - Bedene should not be allowed to represent Britain in the Davis Cup. International Tennis Federation rules do not allow players to represent more than one country in the Davis Cup.

It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the \"\"director's cut\"\", or in this case, \"\"let's salvage whatever we can\"\" from this notorious box office flop.

When details were leaked on 7 August about the bullying and harassment case, they did not include the alleged remarks made to the player, which Aluko claimed had \"derogatory, racial and prejudicial connotations\". The comments are understood to have made the victim feel extremely uncomfortable. It was also revealed last week that Aluko received about \u00a380,000 in a settlement with the FA, but the governing body said the 30-year-old was not \"precluded from speaking about the facts of that complaint\". It said it had agreed \"a mutual resolution\" with her to avoid disrupting the England squad's preparations for Euro 2017, which ended in a semi-final defeat by the Netherlands earlier this month. Aluko, who is also a lawyer, responded in a statement to confirm that she \"raised a grievance against the FA as a result of treatment that I and others previously suffered\". In her original evidence submitted to the FA, Aluko said: \"During a meeting, at which I was not present, MS [Sampson] used an analogy about "}

Hamilton said he had an \"off day\" in qualifying and Mercedes were at a loss to understand what happened. But in the race it was different. After a cautious start, Hamilton began to make up ground, picking up positions until he was fourth, right behind Force India's Sergio Perez after 11 laps - helped by an early stop for Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. But Hamilton could not pass the slippery Force India and began to run into vibration problems from the tyres, which he had damaged in qualifying. Mercedes tried to pass Perez by stopping earlier but Force India thwarted them by bringing in the Mexican the next lap. After the pit stop, Hamilton tried to pass Perez again but then began to drop back. It emerged from communication between driver and team that there was a problem with an engine setting - but the team radio restrictions meant the team could not tell him what was wrong or how to fix it. It is not yet completely clear what had happened - although the team said it was \"a problem with the setting you are in\" but that \"it's not something you've done - it's a setting that is incorrect\".

As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, specially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law. In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.
