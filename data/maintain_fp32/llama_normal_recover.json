French fighter jets are already taking part in strikes in Iraq with Belgium and the Netherlands each pledging six F-16s planes and Denmark deploying seven.

He said it would take more than air power to recapture lost territory in Syria and neighbouring Iraq but a ground force did not need to involve US troops. \"In fact, ideally for the kind of issues we are confronting there, the only truly effective force that will actually be able to reject Isil (IS) from within its own population is a force comprised of Iraqis and Kurds and moderate Syrian opposition,\" he said.

Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area prior, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School, (later renamed California State University at Fresno).

There were encouraging signs in a painful defeat against Australia, a clinical edge - eventually - in a tight endgame against Argentina and a six-try victory over Georgia, a side that many of us expected would scrummage and scrap their way to a much closer scoreline than 43-16. Scotland's attacking game is improving, no question. Their ability to make things happen out of nothing is on the rise and the arrival of Huw Jones has been a boost. That Scottish midfield is showing serious depth now - Jones, Alex Dunbar, Duncan Taylor, Mark Bennett, Peter Horne, Matt Scott. That's as good as it has been, possibly forever. The Australia game showed that Scotland have the artillery to find space and the wit to score against the elite. It was the one that got away after the one that got away in the World Cup last year, but if they can learn the lessons then, come the Six Nations, it will have been worth the angst. Against Argentina, in a brutal and second-rate game, Scotland dug it out, which says something about their mental strength. On Saturday against the Georgians, they put the game to bed in little over 30 minutes after a terrible beginning. It is easy to see Scotland's upside, but just as easy to see their weaknesses. Their front-liners are strong and many of them have their best years ahead of them, but this is a paper-thin squad in terms of true Six Nations class. There has been added depth this autumn in the front row. Alasdair Dickinson and WP Nel remain the first-choice props but Allan Dell and Zander Fagerson have done themselves a power of good.

His outspoken support for civil rights endeared him to millions of people across the world. He was born Cassius Marcellus Clay in Louisville, Kentucky, on 17 January 1942, the son of a sign painter. He was named after a prominent 19th Century abolitionist. When he was 12, he reported his bicycle had been stolen and told a police officer he was going to \"whup\" the culprit. The officer, Joe Martin, trained young fighters at a local gym and suggested the youngster learn to box before he challenged the thief. Clay quickly took to the ring, making his competitive debut in 1954 in a three-minute amateur bout. \"He stood out because he had more determination than most boys,\" Martin later recalled. \"He was easily the hardest worker of any kid I ever taught.\" Over the following five years, his amateur career flourished and he won a number of awards including the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions in 1959. In 1960 he was selected in the US team for the Rome Olympics. At first he refused to go because of his fear of flying. Eventually, according to Joe Martin's son, he bought a second-hand parachute and wore it on the flight. It was worth all the effort. On 5 September 1960, he beat Poland's Zbigniew Pietrzykowski to become the Olympic light-heavyweight champion. He received a hero's welcome when the team returned to New York but the reality of the segregated US society hit home when he got back to Kentucky and was refused a table in a restaurant. Ali claimed in his 1975 autobiography that he threw away his Olympic medal in disgust but it was later revealed that he lost it a year after his return from Rome. Though only 18, he joined boxing's paid ranks and began his professional career later the same year with a six-round points win over Tunney Hunsaker, a police chief from West Virginia. \"Clay was as fast as lightning,\" Hunsaker said after the bout. \"I tried every trick I knew to throw him off "}

Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine 'Raider'. Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town. In the local caf\u00e9 he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Staying with Hudkins parents, Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine 'Raider' could still be so innocent. The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps, as the towns folks go 'hunting' 3 escapees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But there's still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of his 70's performances.

Mr Evans said falling numbers over recent years were due to rumours regarding the school's future. Plans to close the Wakeman have centred on finances, rather than improving educational standards.

He took along a 1,500-strong entourage - including 25 princes - and hundreds of tonnes of equipment and luxury goods. When the king disembarked the plane - via his own gold-coloured escalator - there were at least 2,500 Indonesian police and military personnel ready for him to guard the island.

Question were being asked about whether the beach would be closed during his visit, as happened on a public beach in southern France two years ago.

The showed the total cost was 126bn euro and of that 51bn (\u00a343bn) euro was down to healthcare costs including doctors' time and drug costs. Lost productivity, because of work missed through sickness or dying young, cost 52bn (\u00a344bn) euro while the cost to families of providing care was put at 23bn (\u00a319.5bn) euro. Overall, richer countries, such as Germany and Luxembourg, spent more on cancer treatment per person than eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Lithuania. Lung cancer accounted for more than a tenth of all cancer costs in Europe. The deadly cancer tends to affect people at an earlier age than other cancers so the lost productivity through early deaths is a major factor. However, the overall economic burden is behind the costs of dementia and cardiovascular disease.

We have heard a lot about the revolt against the political elites, the backlash by those \"left behind\" by globalization; a lot about the movements and political personalities this has brought to the fore; a lot about the implications for immigration. But not so much about the economics of it all. It many signal a new rejection of one of the global elite's most cherished policies - free trade. This is the notion that the fewer economic barriers around the world, and the less countries protect their own goods and trade with special policies, the richer we all end up. The opposite is protectionism - making foreign goods more expensive by putting taxes on their import , tariffs, in order to make home-grown products cheaper by comparison. While few embrace the word protectionism, growing numbers of politicians are openly embracing the principle behind it. Donald Trump has said he would put a swingeing 45% tax on goods from China and 35% on many from Mexico. Many economists mock this as crazy stuff, but it is a sentiment that goes down well with many Americans. I remember well talking to a wide variety of people at \"the biggest little flea market in the world\" in Kentucky, including a man sadly selling Western-style cowboy belts made in China. Just about everyone I spoke to complained about \"the jobs going to Mexico and China\". Trump is not alone, and this is a sentiment not only of the right. Bernie Sanders has made it very clear he is opposed to NAFTA, the free trade bloc with Mexico and Canada, and the planned Asia Pacific agreement.

And two years earlier, Kenneth Cole, boss of the eponymous clothing and accessories brand, tweeted this howler during the Egyptian revolution: \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now online...\" The twitterstorm that followed forced him to make a swift apology in which he admitted that his tweet had been \"insensitive\" and \"absolutely inappropriate\". So perhaps it is no wonder only 10% of the chief executives running the world's 50 largest companies regularly tweet, according to a survey by marketing consultancy Weber Shandwick. The risk of contracting foot-in-mouth disease seems just too high for many. But Robert Glaesener, boss of Twitter analytics firm Talkwalker, believes the fact that most of them are aged 50-to-60 has more to do with it - they're simply too old to understand social media fully, he says. Even tweeting extrovert Sir Richard Branson, who has more than six million followers and epitomises the consumer-friendly, approachable boss, is prone to the occasional gaffe. His tweet on the day of the fatal Virgin Galactic crash last year began: \"Space is hard - but worth it.\" This was considered insensitive by some commentators and led others to question the legitimacy of his space tourism mission. \"There is a real danger that something that is well meant can end up creating cynicism on social media,\" warns Mr Glaesener. \"While most of the responses to that tweet were positive and supportive, there were also negative responses with people questioning his motives.\" But leaving Twitter campaigns to your corporate PR team sometimes isn't any better. When British Gas decided to hold a Twitter Q&A with customers on the same day it announced price rises of 9.2%, it led to a barrage of abuse hurled at the then customer services director, Bert Pijls.

But some of those comments also made it apparent that there is a fair amount of confusion regarding the details of the conference's television rights, particularly third tier rights, and what impact they will likely have on the conference's future.It ultimately comes down to the fact that ACC schools do not retain third tier rights for football or basketball games, a sacrifice that was not rewarded with comparable rights fees to those paid to the other \"major\" conferences. That does not mean that ACC schools are entirely without valuable media rights, but it puts the conference at a significant disadvantage and has led schools like Florida State and Clemson to consider leaving the ACC for another conference.To quickly cover the basics: there are three tiers of media rights. The first and second tiers are generally controlled by the conferences, which sell them - either separately or combined - to national networks like ABC/ESPN, CBS and Fox. The first tier rights holder gets first pick of the conference's televised sporting events, usually for over-the-air broadcasts.

In Pola X, Carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. Well, here it is: the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with; superfluous characters abound (e.g., the Gypsy mother and child); most of the performances are overwrought; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft-discussed sex scene; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason; and the list goes on.<br /><br />Not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were"}

Col Lee said the circumstances surrounding the killing needed to be reconsidered. \"A much more balanced and full picture of the situation in which he found himself needed to be presented,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Blackman applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) after his earlier appeal was dismissed in 2014, which referred the conviction to the court after an 11-month investigation. The court will look at new expert evidence relating to Blackman's mental state at the time of the killing. It will also consider that the alternative verdict of \"unlawful act manslaughter\" was not available at his original trial. Col Lee said the court martial should have taken greater account of the acute stress Blackman was under at the time. \"I don't seek to condone his behaviour or exonerate him from his responsibilities,\" he said. \"I took a view that the proceedings against Sgt Blackman hadn't been balanced.\" David James Smith, lead CCRC commissioner on the case, said there was a \"real possibility\" that Blackman's second appeal would be successful. \"There are new issues - principally relating to Mr Blackman's state of mind"}

Sebastian Vettel is definitely staying for 2017, but the team have to decide whether to keep the 2007 world champion Kimi Raikkonen, whose contract ends this year. This is a prime seat. It's not a Mercedes, but it is the next best thing at the moment. And Ferrari have their own special pull. In my opinion, Ferrari should look at a change. In fact, I think they should have done so last year. I can see why they didn't given the new management and technical structure was still bedding in, but things have settled down now and they have to build towards the future. Whether you like it or not, Raikkonen, who turns 37 in October, is not the future. He is a former world champion, but his best performances are in the past. The last driver to win the world title with Ferrari, the Finn's form has been questionable since he rejoined the team in 2014. He was comprehensively out-paced by Fernando Alonso that year - and by Vettel when the four-time world champion arrived in 2015. Raikkonen has improved this season, but has he done enough? I keep looking to the Spanish Grand Prix, where he was second behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen. He never applied enough pressure when he had the chance to chase the Dutchman down, not once showing his nose to Verstappen. In reality, the question is not whether Raikkonen is good enough to keep his place at Ferrari - it's whether there is someone better. Lots of drivers have been linked with them over the last few years. Among them was Nico Hulkenberg, who was on Ferrari's list when they re-signed Raikkonen for 2014. In fact, I understand 28-year-old Hulkenberg got as close as signing a Ferrari contract - it just wasn't signed by Ferrari.

The British introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits as well the export of lumber. As a result, the northeastern Florida area prospered economically more than it had under the Spanish. Britain ceded control of the territory back to Spain in 1783, after its defeat in the American Revolutionary War, and the settlement at the Cow Ford continued to grow. After Spain ceded the Florida Territory to the United States in 1821, American settlers on the north side of the Cow Ford decided to plan a town, laying out the streets and plats.

A debate with that many participants would either take all day or reduce the speakers to the shortest of soundbites. It's a situation British party and media officials grappled with earlier this year, when deciding who would be included in their general election debates. Those left out, such as Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, vociferously complained. Even during the Republican primary debates four years ago, with at most \"only\" nine entrants at a time, the proceedings risked becoming an out-of-control circus act, with candidates at one point asked to respond to questions with a show of hands. Recently word leaked out that the Republican Party was recommending that media debate sponsors limit participation to a maximum of 12 candidates. That set off a round of nail-biting, hair-pulling and rampant speculation about who would, or wouldn't, make the cut when the first event rolls around in Cleveland on 6 August. \"How do you pull off a nationally televised debate with more than a dozen announced candidates when the usual barriers to entry that winnow the field of contenders could do more harm than good?\" asks the Washington Examiner's David M Drucker.

By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Those who chronicle the lives of the Cambridges now know that balloons are the way to a 16-month-old princess's heart and Charlotte's first public utterance was to use the word \"pop\".

The power of the images is considerable. The children personify the future of the Canadian monarchy in a country that may, one day, chose a different path. There's no sign, at the moment, of that being the desire of the majority of Canadians. George and Charlotte, on display, will not become an everyday occurrence.

First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell"}

A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, \"\"Good Time Charlie\"\" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation.

Prices have dropped due to oversupply and weaker demand. On an underlying basis, profit for the third quarter was $1.8bn, down from $3bn a year earlier but higher than analysts' estimates of $1.2bn.

BP continued to rein in spending estimates for 2015, which it now expects to be about $19bn compared with the $24bn-$26bn forecast a year ago.

This acts like a decorator around the parameter object because it wraps around it and adds to its functionality from the outside (in this case sends a notification after the action is performed).The reason why the decorator must implement the same interface is to make sure it has the same public API as the decorated one.

Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters.

Yet, evolution of lactase persistence has divided the human species into those that can or cannot digest lactose in adulthood. Such a ubiquitous trait has differential effects on humanity. The literature is reviewed to explore how the divide affects lactose handling by lactase non persistent persons. There are two basic differences in digesters. Firstly, maldigesters consume less dairy foods, and secondly, excess lactose is digested by colonic microflora. Lactose intolerance in maldigesters may occur with random lactose ingestion. However, lactose intolerance without maldigestion tends to detract from gaining a clear understanding of the mechanisms of symptoms formation and leads to confusion with regards to dairy food consumption. The main consequence of intolerance is withholding dairy foods. However, regular dairy food consumption by lactase non persistent people could lead to colonic adaptation by the microbiome. This process may mimic a prebiotic effect and allows lactase non persistent people to consume more dairy foods enhancing a favorable microbiome. This process then could lead to alterations in outcome of diseases in response to dairy foods in lactose maldigesters. The evidence that lactose is a selective human prebiotic is reviewed and current links between dairy foods and some diseases are discussed within this context. Colonic adaptation has not been adequately studied, especially with modern microbiological techniques.1. Introduction The ability or inability of adults to digest the disaccharide lactose into its components, glucose and galactose, divides humanity into two Mendelian inherited phenotypes.

Other rail improvements have been unveiled for the Manchester area, south Wales and East Coast Main Line. Prime Minister David Cameron called it the \"biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian era\". During a visit to Birmingham to announce the railway investment,  the PM said it would lead to the electrification of an extra 850 miles of track. He said: \"This investment will mean faster journeys, more seats, better access to stations, greater freight links and a truly world-class rail network.\" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who joined the PM on the visit, said the plans would help \"close the north south divide\". It includes \u00a35.2bn for the completion of current schemes, such as Crossrail and Thameslink and \u00a34.2bn for new projects. These include: Building work on the rail projects will not start until at least 2014, as the announcement covers the period 2014 to 2019. The government said it would be funded \"in part from fare rises already announced in 2010 and also from the substantial efficiency savings which projects like electrification will have on the long-term operating costs of the railways\". In January this year, passengers faced average increases of RPI inflation plus 1% on regulated fares, which are set to rise by RPI plus 3% in January 2013 and 14. Transport Secretary Justine Greening told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had a long-term plan to make the rail industry work more efficiently and stop the above-inflation fare rises. \"We've got to get the money from somewhere so, for the time being, the passengers are paying,\" she said. \"We all know that diesel is massively expensive so if we can move over to electric trains, not only are they greener, they're also cheaper"}

Silicon Glen - the name given to the mainly central belt electronics manufacturing phenomenon - continues to decline. The announcement from Texas Instruments that it is pulling out from Greenock, continues the trend. The tech giant, with 30,000 employees around the world, is to move Greenock's chip fabrication to German, Japanese and American plants - not, you'll note, low wage economies. There go 365 jobs, though not before the end of next year. We've seen plenty such announcements before, few of them easing the pain with such a delay. National Semi-conductor was taken over by the Texans five years ago, having been one of the more significant features of Silicon Glen's topography, since first opening up in Inverclyde in 1970. This was not glamorous work. That Greenock plant was criticised for its working conditions. But the Silicon Glen phenomenon was important to replacing the jobs from old industries, which were dying as electronics arrived. The new manufacturers, often headquartered in the US, Japan and South Korea, helped Scotland's new towns establish themselves as economic hubs. They brought new, more efficient work practices, which benefited the wider economy. And they were a means for bringing many more women into the workforce. The priority then was for the Scottish Development Agency (predecessor of Scottish Enterprise) was to attract inward investment with large job numbers. The quality of the jobs didn't matter so much. Some firms brought higher-skilled jobs, with support services, research and development, so that when the manufacturing left, there was a valuable legacy - at IBM in Greenock, for instance, and NCR in Dundee. But most of these jobs had shallow roots in Scotland. They were rapidly culled after the dotcom bust at the turn of the century, while the opening "}

Links on the site to its adult section now feature the word \"censored\" and direct users to a page that claims the business has been a victim of \"unconstitutional government censorship.\" The adult section's closure had been unexpected. Last month, a judge dismissed a case in which the Californian authorities had claimed that Backpage's chief executive and two of its ex-owners had committed pimping offences and generated millions of dollars by hosting sex trade ads. The basis for the ruling was that US law states that website publishers cannot be held responsible for content created solely by their users. And on Monday, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal filed by three women who had alleged Backpage was at fault because they had been sold as prostitutes via the site when they had been as young as 15. The UK and other international versions of Backpage.com continue to offer their adult sections. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations described Backpage as the \"world's second-largest classified advertising website\", adding that the service was involved in 73% of all child trafficking reports passed from the public over to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). It said the company was aware of the problem, but rather than block suspicious ads had set up a programme that helped remove incriminating words and phrases.

The Chinese ministry statement, posted on its website, said that many hacking attacks were carried out using hijacked IP addresses. By Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic Correspondent The scale of the Chinese hacking alleged by the computer security firm Mandiant is striking. Until now the bulk of this hacking has been a digital version of old-fashioned industrial espionage - stealing designs and company secrets. But there is a more sinister side to this activity as well. Chinese hackers are alleged to have a growing interest in gaining access to key parts of the US infrastructure - gas lines, power grids and waterworks. President Barack Obama himself warned during his recent State of the Union address that the nature of the cyber threat was changing. Gaining access to critical systems is the key. Once inside the digital perimeter - especially if the intrusion is not identified, there is the possibility of causing real physical damage to the infrastructure that the computers control. There was no clear definition of what constituted a hacking attack, it went on, and as it was a cross-border, deceptive business, it was hard to pin down where attacks originated. It suggested that the \"everyday gathering\" of online information was being wrongly characterised as spying. The detailed report, released on Tuesday by US-based computer security company Mandiant, looked at hundreds of data breaches, most of which it attributed to what it termed \"Advanced Persistent Threat\" actors.

The compensation award was to be the largest in history. In its argument on Tuesday, the Hague district court said Russia had never ratified the energy treaty under which the PCA had based its case. Welcoming the court decision, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"The Russian Federation from the very beginning of this case insisted that the decision of the tribunal didn't take into consideration the most important aspects of international law.\" Russian stock indexes rose on Wednesday following the decision. Tim Osborne, director of GML, the company representing Yukos' largest shareholders, said the break-up of Yukos was \"politically motivated\" and the 2014 decision was the right one. \"We will appeal [against] this surprise decision by The Hague Court and have full faith that the rule of law and justice will ultimately prevail,\" he said in a statement. BBC Russian's Yuri Vendik says that while the court's decision does not mean the end of the $50bn compensation case, Russia can use the verdict to avoid having its state assets frozen by the courts in other countries, including Belgium, France, Britain, the US and Germany.

For the past month, son and uncle and their respective factions have been fighting it out, with the patriarch playing mediator. The drama is still unfolding. As of today, several of Akhilesh Yadav's loyalists, including family members Ram Gopal Yadav and Udaiveer Yadav, have been expelled from the party, while Shivpal Yadav and his loyalists have been sacked from the cabinet. It is also not clear who the party's chief ministerial candidate is: although the SP had on 17 October named Akhilesh Yadav as its candidate for chief minister, the Shivpal Yadav faction is now proposing Mulayam Singh Yadav's name for the position. In the meantime, the SP's election campaign has come to a standstill. The Yadavs are only one of several families in charge of India's regional governments. According to data I collected after India's most recent round of regional elections this year, the chief ministers of 14 of India's 31 regional governments, encompassing 53% of India's population, come from political families - that is, they have "}

The task of rebuilding the party in Scotland is vital for the party as a whole. Unless they win back a substantial number of the seats they lost to the SNP, Labour will almost certainly never form a government in Westminster again. If they fail to regain their Scottish heartlands they would have to instead win seats in England that even Tony Blair could not conquer in 1997. The scale of the problem Labour faces in Scotland is demonstrated by a new TNS poll published in the Herald newspaper which suggests 62% of voters intend to vote SNP at next year's Holyrood poll. That would be a huge increase on the 50% who voted SNP in the general election. The Scottish Labour Party got a huge shock when they lost 40 of their 41 Scottish seats in May's general election. But it should not have come as a surprise. They have been in trouble in Scotland for years. One of their previous leaders - former First Minister Henry McLeish - admits the party has been taking voters for granted in Scotland. He told me they had become complacent and entitled.

Despite it being frustrating it was always preferable to playing on international servers, even in southern Asia where you can often expect to be getting 150ms. And their servers are hardly any better anyway and mostly consist of 64-player nade fests on Metro.Personally I'd prefer to see a 32-player rush and 32-player conquest small server with good rotations. I strongly dislike the idea of a 64-player conquest large server since the playerbase is so low I'd prefer to have 2x 32-player servers that both offer a different game mode and/or maps. Conquest small on 32-player is almost as good as 64-player conquest large anyway.Anyway Goose, it's unlikely you're going to achieve much with a forum/Reddit thread. Simply because very few players check the forums on any decent regularity. What I'd suggest is creating a platoon based around this. Getting people to join that platoon is going to give them more of a sense of purpose and community.

She is desperate to achieve a grade C in maths, after missing out by just a few marks on more than one occasion. In 2013, the government introduced a policy that said students in England who fail to get a grade C or above in GCSE maths or English should carry on studying the subject, or subjects, until the age of 18, with the aim of achieving this mark. It means hundreds of thousands of pupils like Georgina - who is also studying for A-levels in drama and health and social care - are taking resits up to twice an academic year. Figures from the Department for Education show that 77.3% of students in England do not attain a C grade in English or maths when they resit the exam post-16. \"You've got to keep going because I need it to get a job and get into university,\" she says. \"I'm so close and it's so frustrating.\" At Tolworth Girls' School's sixth form, in Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, Georgina and her friends are taught resit classes, but the teachers' busy timetables mean they are limited to just a couple of hours per week. Chloe Gatt, the school's head of English, says budget strains mean it is difficult to find enough staff to cover those teaching the extra lessons. Were she not teaching the resit class, she would probably be with her Year 7 or 8 pupils, or her A-level students, she says.

Fifteen governors had called on Obama and the EPA to withdraw the proposed regulations, which would cut carbon pollution from existing power plants.Some electricity companies had argued that the rules were extraordinarily complex, clocking in at about 1,600 pages, and they needed extra time to study the full implications.But a delay puts the EPA on an even tighter deadline to finalise the rule before Obama leaves office in 2016.

In May of 2016, the European Central bank announced it will stop producing and issuing 500-euro notes by the end of 2018. Not long before the EU announcement, a former Obama economic adviser/ex-Treasury secretary floated the idea of eliminating the $100 bill in the US.Banks have also gotten in on the act. Last year, Chase capped ATM withdrawals for non-Chase customers at $1,000 per day. Recently, ATMs in Mexico stopped issuing 500-peso notes, leaving the 200-peso note as the highest denomination available. CitiBank Australia stopped handling cash transactions altogether late last year.Indians also felt the squeeze last fall. On Nov. 8, the Indian government declared that 1,000 and 500 rupee notes would no longer be valid. They gave the public just four hours notice. Why? To force so-called \"black money\" into the light.About 90% of all transactions in India are in cash.

Mrs Hunter Gordon made hundreds of the nappies using a sewing machine at her kitchen table, supplying friends with the product and constantly modifying the design. Her husband, Major Pat Hunter Gordon, was also pressed into helping make the nappies when he returned from fighting in Borneo. Speaking to the BBC in 2015, Mrs Hunter Gordon said she had found washing nappies much too laborious and so began searching for disposables. \"I thought you must be able to buy them - but you couldn't, not anywhere,\" she said. \"It seemed extraordinary that it hadn't been done before. I thought, it's easy, I'll make them. But it wasn't easy. It was quite tricky. \"Everybody who saw them said, Valerie, please would you make one for me? And so I ended up by making about over 600 of them. \"I spent my time sitting at my mother's sewing machine, making these wretched things.\" Paddis replaced absorbent cotton towelling nappies, which had to be washed after each use. \"Everybody wanted to stop washing nappies.

Hodgson then removed man of the match Wayne Rooney, who had earlier seen a shot pushed superbly on to the post by Akinfeev, and replaced him with Jack Wilshere to preserve England's advantage. It was a move that failed when Russia snatched a point - and extended England's record of never starting a European Championship with a win - two minutes into four minutes of stoppage time, Berezutski soaring above Danny Rose at the far post to send Georgi Schennikov's header looping over keeper Joe Hart. The final whistle was the cue for more of the violence that has marred the build-up to this fixture, as Russian fans appeared to charge at English supporters behind the goal where Berezutski scored. England manager Roy Hodgson got plenty right with a positive selection and the decision to play Rooney in midfield reaped a rich reward - but his boldest move may also have been his biggest mistake. He removed Rooney straight after Dier's goal and introduced Wilshere in an attempt to retain possession, but Rooney was the player giving England control and while it was a warm night in the south of France, the 30-year-old looked fresh and fit for the fight. True, it was a sucker punch that cost England victory but experience is needed to close out crucial wins and ultimately they did not manage it. England should have had enough against a very ordinary Russia to complete the job but Rooney's removal robbed them of his craft and guidance and now increases the pressure on Thursday's meeting with Wales in Lens. In Hodgson's defence, it must be stated that in large parts this was a vibrant, energetic performance with the emphasis almost exclusively on attack. England were hugely impressive in the first half in particular, when their supporters inside this magnificent bowl at Stade Velodrome roared their approval as Russia were pressed into submission and made to look pedestrian. It made that cruel conclusion even more painful. Rooney was the subject of some mischievous probing from the Russia media before the game as they suggested his retreat into midfield "}

It isn't totally successful (mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints, and the less-than-professional caliber of its cast of young actors) but it still has its moments, mostly due to the classy performance (classier than the movie deserves) by the late German actor Ferdinand Mayne, who plays an aging old time horror movie star (ala Vincent Price) named \"\"Conrad Ratzoff.\"\" At the beginning of the movie we meet the has-been horror star as he's shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol' Conrad is a bit of a hoity-toity, prima donna jerk-off.

The Syrian Kurds are fleeing an advance by Islamic State (IS) militants, who have seized swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent months. IS fighters are reported to be closing in on the Syrian town of Kobane. The capture of Kobane, also known as Ayn al-Arabon, would give the jihadists complete control of the area. Even before the latest influx, Turkey was struggling to cope with more than a million Syrian refugees who have crossed into its territory since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began more than three years ago. Carol Batchelor, the UNHCR's envoy in Turkey, told the BBC that such high numbers of refugees would place a strain on any host community. The sheer number of refugees would overwhelm any country. Added to that, they are Kurds from Syria, many of them deeply hostile to Turkey. For 30 years, Turkish forces fought Kurdish rebels in a civil war that killed 40,000 people. The fact that Turkey is accepting tens of thousands of Kurds is a sign of how allegiances are being forced to change with the onslaught of Islamic State. But deep-seated tension between Kurds and Turks have again come to the surface, leading to border clashes on Sunday. Turkey fears that Kurds will cross into Syria to join the Kurdish militia. The worry is that, renewed by fresh recruits, it could ally with the outlawed PKK and launch attacks on Turkish soil.

Professor Keep was commenting on pay levels revealed in the first part of BBC Radio 4's series The New Workplace. To help understanding of the changing workplace, Whitbread, the large British-based hospitality and services company, opened its doors to the BBC at all levels of the company. Once famous for Whitbread's Best Bitter, with all the industrialised, unionised processes required to manufacture beer, Whitbread has transformed itself over the past 20 years. Today Whitbread owns Costa Coffee, the largest chain of coffee shops in the UK, Beefeater Restaurants and the fast-growing budget hotel chain Premier Inn. Whitbread has 45,000 employees, yet is run by a strategic management team of just 60. The company is now \"very lean\", Louise Smalley, Whitbread's Human Resources director told the BBC. Ms Smalley has been with Whitbread for 18 years. She says new technology is a key reason Whitbread's former layers of middle management disappeared. \"Often you needed middle management to collate the data\", Ms Smalley said. \"Technology has enabled that to happen instantly. That's a world away from what we had historically so we don't need those middle management layers.\" Like most companies in its sector, Whitbread no longer recognises trade unions. Whitbread has always paid above the national minimum wage, but otherwise pay in the company is set by supply and demand. According to Jim Slater, Managing Director of the Costa coffee shop chain, there is no shortage of potential workers. \"Last year we opened a new store in Nottinghamshire,\" Mr Slater told the BBC, \"and we had over 200 applicants per position in that store\". Even in hot-spots such as London, Brighton or Bristol, Mr Slater says, \"We always are inundated with applicants for jobs\". Mr Slater told the BBC that the functions middle managers used to perform are now carried out much closer to the workplace.

But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality, we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking. If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience. This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations. The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes, \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.\" By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.

The nine scholars analyzing Japan's economic crisis from 1985 through 2000 have identified six underlying causes:Surplus in Savings: Japan has traditionally enjoyed an unusually high savings rate and a comparatively low consumption rate. During the decades of recovery and high-speed growth, this \"savings surplus\" supplied sorely needed capital to private industry in the form of bank loans. This money was used to build and expand Japan's industrial infrastructure and to achieve the rank of a world-class manufacturing power. However, during the 1990s, the \"savings surplus\", once the indispensable fuel for high-speed growth, became a serious, structural impediment, leading to a severe slump in demand and causing a heavy drag on Japan's economic recovery.Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Vested Interest Groups: LDP support from interest groups representing protected, inefficient sectors of the Japanese economy has contributed to Japan's economic malaise but has also made it difficult for the Japanese state to implement the reforms necessary to get back on track. Focused on staying in power, the LDP has been reluctant to implement far-reaching reforms or tackle the tough issues, such as the ominous overhang of nonperforming loans (NPLs). The LDP's coalition of interest group supporters, which supplies money and votes, has lobbied hard to sandbag or dilute reform measures. The unprecedented "}

Stretching of units can result in their thinning; in fact, there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter. Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed.

The first stumbling block was the shock US decision to halt nuclear co-operation with Britain at the end of World War II. From being partners in the fabled Manhattan Project, Britain was left initially largely to its own (nuclear) devices. But the then Labour Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, declared that Britain had to have a nuclear weapon with a \"bloody Union Jack on top of it\". Britain did become the third country, after the US and the Soviet Union, to test an atomic device, in October 1952. But just 17 months later, the Americans detonated their first, much more powerful thermonuclear device - or hydrogen bomb - at Bikini Atoll. The race to catch up was on again. The British began a new series of tests based on Christmas Island in the Pacific in May 1957. After the first test, the government proudly proclaimed that Britain, too, had become a thermonuclear power. But that, it turned out, was a bluff, in order not to undermine the perception of Britain as a first-rate power. The explosive power of the initial devices was disappointing, and they were not H-bombs in the accepted sense - they were fission rather than fusion bombs. It would not be until 1961 that the British possessed an operational H-bomb. Ironically, the advent of the H-bomb era fired up the anti-nuclear movement. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament was able to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people on marches to \"ban the bomb\". The issue was at the centre of British politics. There was also another challenge for the military: how to deliver its nuclear weapons. This was"}

Right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well-done satire of the whole Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the famous showdown in the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It is too bad Mr. Maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved.

These awards were to replace the ribbon bars that were being earned at the time. The list of knots has continued to grow. Some knots have been discontinued and others have been added. At present there are 34 knot awards. These awards are worn on the Scouting uniform in place of the plaque or large pendant that they represent.Generally, the knot awards are worn by adult leaders. But there are a few that may be worn by youth members. Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts may wear the Universal Religious Emblem and the lifesaving and Meritorious Award knots. Explorers may display on their uniforms the same honors plus the Explorer Achievement Award knot.Knots are sewn centered above the top seam of the left uniform shirt pocket, in rows of three.

McManus was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 26 years. Ms Sanders' brother James Dougall says whole life terms would protect the public from violent criminals. During a trial at the High Court in Glasgow last year a jury heard that Ms Sanders was stabbed 37 times during the robbery. McManus was also convicted of attempting to murder her partner, Norman Busby, 86, and two robbery-related stabbings. After the trial, it emerged McManus had been released from a previous sentence just weeks before the murder. The judge who sentenced him highlighted his \"significant\" criminal record, which included convictions for theft, assault and robbery and the use of weapons. Lord Armstrong pointed out that the 20-year-old had already served seven sentences of detention. Ms Sanders' family has lodged a petition with Holyrood's petitions committee which they hope will attract widespread public support. Her brother, Mr Dougall, told BBC Scotland: \"It is maybe not applicable for every violent offender, but certainly for violent reoffenders who get the chance of early release and then go on to reoffend and who disregard that chance they have been given and go on to commit violent murder specifically. \"I think (in these cases) the whole of life sentence is an appropriate option for the judiciary and guidance "}

Staff from the EU make up nearly a quarter of all jobs in the sector. Immigration is set to be one of the most controversial issues to be settled during the Brexit negotiations. The hospitality industry represents 3 million workers and about a tenth of the UK's economic wealth. In the first major business intervention since the triggering of Article 50, a report by KPMG for the BHA says that it will take 10 years to reduce the need for EU workers by training British staff, targeting older workers and encouraging younger people to take jobs in the sector. But with the UK economy approaching full employment, the report says that there are no easy pools of labour to exploit and that EU nationals will still make up a large part of the workforce. The KPMG study - which has been sent to Number 10 - says that 75% of waiting staff in the UK, 37% of house-keeping staff and a quarter of all chefs are from the EU. Last month the sandwich and coffee chain Pret a Manger revealed that only one in fifty of its applicants was British and 65% of its workforce were EU nationals. The company's head of human resources, Andrea Wareham, said it would be virtually impossible to recruit enough staff if heavy controls were applied to EU nationals wanting to work in the UK. \"It is clear that hospitality and tourism face major problems in recruitment if there is any major cut in the number of workers allowed to enter from the EU,\" Ufi Ibrahim, head of the BHA, said. \"We want to avoid there being any cliff edge but the government must be aware that in the medium to long term we will still need considerable numbers of EU"}

While riding in a topless car in a motorcade on Nov. 22, 1963, he was shot and killed by a sniper. An investigative team, the Warren Commission, determined the shooter was Lee Harvey Oswald, though Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby before he could stand trial.For decades, controversy and suspicion have swirled around the actual details of that day, with many conspiracy theorists and renowned historians alike believing that Oswald did not act alone, or may even have been used as an innocent scapegoat.With an abundance of theories and contradicting information surrounding some details of this tragically historic day, some information is more concrete. The weather of the day has been carefully recorded, and may have played a role in how the event transpired.RELATEDHow Weather Impacted the Bloodiest Battle of the Civil WarWeather History Video ChannelAccuWeather Severe Weather CenterDr. Michael L.

Example: Kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his \"\"wedding.\"\" Kennedy is the bride, done up in a full bridal gown and long wig. The \"\"joke\"\" is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his \"\"bits and pieces.\"\" Problem is, this schtick goes on way too long, obviously to fill out time. And Kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took Kennedy to get through this one, running around, constantly asking \"\"Do I look fat?\"\" I recognize the show was not made for me.

He's pulled the Republicans' fannies out of the fire, flipping a losing strategy into a big-time winner.The Cruz amendment -- which has been inserted into the GOP Senate health plan -- is smart, because it doesn't take anything away from anyone.

It's still there for you.The Cruz amendment introduces what is called the \"Consumer Freedom Option.\" The Consumer Freedom Option allows insurers who offer Obamacare-compliant plans to offer a range of less costly plans. In other words, it empowers people and families to pick and choose what they want in their own insurance packages. Some families want, and can afford, blanket coverage that insures them for everything from cancer to contraceptives. If you want to pay for that coverage, go for it.What about people with lower incomes or healthy lifestyles that want the other extreme?

Mrs Booth's withdrawal comes on the same day a winding-up order against the club was dismissed. The order, brought by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, was dismissed at a short hearing at the High Court in London after Wrexham paid off its \u00a3200,000 tax bill last month. This was done through a combination of donations and loans, but despite this, ownership of the club still needs to be resolved. Mrs Booth, who runs hotels and other businesses in the Llangollen, Wrexham and Mold areas, has been linked with the takeover for several months. The club first announced it was looking for a buyer in January when owner Geoff Moss and chairman Ian Roberts said they were stepping down from the board. Several bidders have said they are interested. Former footballer Ashley Ward, who started his career at the club, said he had held preliminary talks while businessman Stephen Cleeve outlined his interest on the Red Passion website. But since Mrs Booth and the trust announced they would work together they have been seen to be favourites. Last month the club survived a \u00a3200,000 tax demand when the money was paid"}

It says \"probability sampling\" may be a more accurate way of gauging voters' intentions than the current practice of recruiting people in advance to take part on the basis of their likely voting habits. The majority of polls taken during the five-week general election campaign indicated the Conservatives and Labour, led by David Cameron and Ed Miliband respectively, were neck-and-neck. This led to speculation that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament and could potentially have to rely on SNP support to govern. However the Conservatives secured an overall majority for the first time since 1992, winning 99 more seats than Labour, their 6.5% margin of victory taking nearly all commentators by surprise. The BPC, which represents the major survey bodies and issued an interim report into the findings in January, says the Tory win was not foreseen due to \"systemic\" errors.

Pettway was convicted of five crimes while Ms White was in her custody, according to a probation department, and had used cocaine from 1983 to 2005.

In a letter ahead of the sentencing hearing, Pettway apologised and said the kidnapping would have never occurred if she had sought professional help after her failed pregnancies. \"Because of my actions so many lives were hurt,\" she said, adding that she had raised \"a wonderful bright young woman\".

Without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid, the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small; in steam turbines, turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 \u00b0C (the creep limit of stainless steel) and condenser temperatures are around 30 \u00b0C. This gives a theoretical Carnot efficiency of about 63% compared with an actual efficiency of 42% for a modern coal-fired power station. This low turbine entry temperature (compared with a gas turbine) is why the Rankine cycle is often used as a bottoming cycle in combined-cycle gas turbine power stations.[citation needed]"}

Sir Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, produced a report in May on three cases linked to the alleged rape of M\u00e1ir\u00eda Cahill. She told a BBC NI programme that an IRA member raped her when she was 16. She had accused the PPS and the police of failing to properly investigate her allegations. The PPS apologised to Ms Cahill after the report by Sir Keir concluded that it had \"let down\" her and other victims. Mr McGrory told the justice committee on Thursday that the report was \"more difficult reading\" for the PPS and acknowledged that \"blurred\" lines of communication with the organisation was one of the problems.

I dislike my own answers almost as much as I dislike everybody else's.The absolute worst of the common answers is \"UUs can believe whatever they want.\" In fact the exact opposite is true.

Last year, it unsuccessfully took NHS England to court for restricting access to the medicine on cost grounds. The charity denied being influenced by the drugs industry. It said it had always acted in the interests of patients. In 2016, the Hepatitis C Trust brought a High Court action against NHS England to try to force it to reconsider a controversial decision to limit, or \"ration\", a new cure for hepatitis C. The new range of pills, which has completely changed the way hepatitis C is treated, is thought to be 95% effective at curing the disease within eight weeks. Before this, it could only be cured with a year of injections, often with damaging side-effects likened to those of chemotherapy. The first of these new drugs, Sovaldi - manufactured by Gilead - has a list price of \u00a334,983 for a 12-week course, although a confidential deal with NHS England will have reduced the final cost to the health service. In 2015, the health watchdog NICE ruled it was cost-effective compared with older medicines. NHS England set aside an extra \u00a3200m a year to pay for Sovaldi and other new hepatitis C treatments. But in 2016, faced with the high price of the new pills, it decided to limit the drug to 10,000 people a year, rising to 15,000 by 2021. An estimated 215,000 people in the UK are infected with hepatitis C, a virus that can cause liver damage and cancer. Access is not restricted in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.

These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground. They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7, 13 or 17 years, at which point they fly about, breed, and then die after a few weeks at most. The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas. If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects."}

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms."}

This leads one to wonder\u2014 how can WordPress be more developer-friendly? What are the major pain points that developers are experiencing?While there definitely won't be a single answer for these questions, there are some things that we can do to make WordPress easier to work with. Today we'll be looking at ways to speed up WordPress development using tools like the WP-CLI, custom shell scripts, and Alfred.This short tutorial was written for OS X, but can be easily adapted for Linux and Windows. It also assumes that you have a basic webserver setup (MAMP or XAMPP will do), and that you have WP-CLI installed. Alfred, a productivity app for OS X, is also featured in this article, but isn't necessary to implement most of the items covered.Let's get started!SetupSetting up a dedicated folder for your development scripts is not only cleaner than adding them to an existing directory such as /usr/local/bin/ , but it also facilitates sharing or syncing your scripts with multiple development environments.To do this, create your custom script folder:mkdir ~/ScriptsThen you'll need to add the folder to your environment PATH by editing your ~/.bash_profile file and adding the following line:export PATH=/Users/$USER/Scripts:$PATHOnce you've saved the ~/.bash_profile , you'll need to restart your Terminal session or run source ~/.bash_profile for the changes to take effect.Finally, create a file called config.sh with the following contents in your ~/Scripts folder:#! /bin/bash"}

Their home ground Tatnam, in the grounds of a secondary school, is set to be graded by an inspection. The club will be relegated should they fail to pass the inspection, which requires a minimum amount of terracing for standing and upgrade their floodlights. \"It's a massive ask for those of us running the club to maintain our National League position from a financial point of view,\" vice-chairman Chris Reeves told BBC Radio Solent. \"On the pitch, the team have done us proud.

There is no real story, the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies, but they are not real creatures with a soul. Actually nothing happens.

The WMO says that patterns of cloudiness and rainfall near the international dateline developed during the second quarter of this year and have been well maintained. These patterns are considered essential in triggering El Nino's global climate impacts which are more likely to be felt over the next six to eight months. \"Compared to the last major El Nino event in 1997-1998, there is much more information available,\" said Maxx Dilley from WMO. \"We have "}

Ellie was their first child and Jennie took on nearly all of the baby's care. Ellie was six weeks old when Gray dropped her off at Butler's shared flat in south London so she could get a break. In the early evening Butler says he was playing on his computer when he noticed something was wrong. He picked up Ellie who, he later said, had gone \"floppy and sheet white\". Panicking, he called for help from his flatmate who drove the new dad and his ill daughter to hospital. In fact Ellie had suffered a serious head injury. Thankfully, and unusually considering her injuries, she made a full recovery. However, Butler was charged by police and, in March 2009, convicted of causing his daughter grievous bodily harm. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison. The incident was not the first time he had fallen foul of the law. By the time he met Gray, in a wine bar in 2006, he had a series of convictions for violent offences. He had served a three-year sentence for robbery and viciously assaulted an ex-girlfriend, Hannah Hillman, who described him as \"pure evil\" and told police how he could \"flip\" at a moment's notice. He had held a series of menial jobs and spent long periods unemployed. His own family history was dysfunctional, his father had left home before he was born, and his mother and stepfather had a volatile marriage. Despite the assault on her daughter, his violent background and feckless lifestyle, Gray stood by him as he launched an appeal to clear his name. In June 2010 his conviction was quashed. The Court of Appeal had re-examined the highly complex and controversial medical evidence used to convict him and ruled the trial judge had not given the jury proper direction. The judgement said the jury had not been offered the option of considering whether some of Ellie's symptoms were due to an unknown cause. No retrial was ordered. Butler and Gray now began a new fight, this time in the family courts, to get their daughter back. Ellie was now thriving in the care of her maternal grandparents who had taken her in soon after the incident at Butler's flat. By this time Gray and Butler had had another child together who had been taken into care following Butler's conviction for assaulting Ellie. The judge that heard the sibling's case was the vastly experienced Mrs Justice Hogg, who noted that the relationship between Gray and her parents was \"fraught\u2026 feelings are tense and currently, in reality, non-existent\". The local authority children's social services were adamant Ellie should not be returned to Butler and Gray. The battle lines were drawn. Over the spring and summer of 2011, during a series of hearings at the family court, Mrs Justice Hogg heard allegations about Butler's violent character. With every allegation made in court Gray would counter with a denial or an explanation. She had quite a different background from Butler but had a troubled adolescence. A talented artist she attended the Brit school for performing arts and, as a teenager, she had appeared as an extra in a number of TV shows including Silent Witness, EastEnders and The Bill.

During the Oligocene, for example, the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band. It expanded again during the Middle Miocene, then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum. However, the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods, allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species."}

One of them is Goldbach's conjecture, which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes. As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 \u00b7 1017. Weaker statements than this have been proven, for example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any even integer can be written as the sum of six primes. The branch of number theory studying such questions is called additive number theory."}

Mr Garang's death was a blow to the SPLM, coming just three months after he had negotiated a peace deal with the Khartoum government to end about three decades of conflict. Mr Kiir was said to be more militant than Mr Garang, raising fears that the deal would collapse. But Mr Kiir, always seen in public with his trademark cowboy hat, proved to be a deft operator, taking the post of vice-president in Sudan's government and making sure that it upheld the peace accord signed with Mr Garang. This led to South Sudan achieving independence some seven years later in July 2011, securing Mr Kiir a place in history as its political midwife. He had always been in the shadow of Mr Garang, but he proved that he was a leader in his own right when he won elections a year before independence by a huge margin, though there were allegations from the opposition of rigging and intimidation. \"Indeed, many political analysts and opinion leaders worldwide describe him as the Biblical Joshua who took the mantle of leadership from Moses just as the Israelites were on the verge of entering Canaan and capably established the then fugitives in the Promised Land,\" the South Sudan government says on its website.

It lies above the Bering Land Bridge (BLB), also called Beringia (sometimes misspelled Beringea), a submerged landmass that once connected the Siberian mainland with North America. While Beringia's shape and size while above water is variously described in publications, most scholars would agree the land mass included the Seward Peninsula, as well as existing land areas of northeast Siberia and western Alaska, between the Verkhoyansk Range in Siberia and the Mackenzie River in Alaska. As a waterway, the Bering Strait connects the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean over the polar ice cap, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean.The climate of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) when it was above sea level during the Pleistocene was long thought to have been primarily a herbaceous tundra or steppe-tundra. However, recent pollen studies have shown that during the Last Glacial Maximum (say, between 30,000-18,000 calendar years ago, abbreviated as cal BP), the environment was a mosaic of diverse but cold plant and animal habitats.Living on the Bering Land BridgeWhether Beringia was habitable or not at a given time is determined by the sea level and presence of surrounding ice: specifically, whenever the sea level drops about 50 meters (~164 feet) below its present position, the land surfaces.

At the approach of its centennial, Saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland. The twelve \"\"impressions\"\" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings, allowing the power of each performance to explode before Saura's camera. Creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song, dance and instrumental performance. Photographs of Albeniz reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of the music to its great creator. Saura encompasses all Spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.\""}

This was the only girls' dormitory in Aladag, and the girls who lived here came from impoverished families in nearby villages.

Bennett was a graduate of the Alpha Boys School in Jamaica's capital of Kingston, which was also attended by saxophonist Tommy McCook and trombonist Don Drummond, both of whom also became reggae pioneers. He was a session musician at producer Leslie Kong's Beverley's Records in 1962 when Marley, then aged 16, recorded Judge Not - a ska song. That year, Bennett also played on Hurricane Hattie, the first hit song by 14-year-old James Chambers, who later became famous as Jimmy Cliff. Bennett is survived by a brother, two children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

As Stevan Little says:We are not putting \"Moose into the core\" because Moose is too opinionated, instead we want to put a minimal and less opinionated MOP in the core that is capable of hosting something like MooseAs far as I understood, after a first attempt that failed, Stevan Little restarted the p5-mop implementation: the so-called p5-mop-redux github project, using Devel::Declare, ( then Parse::Keyword ), so that he can experiment and release often, while keeping the implementation core-friendly. Once he's happy with the features and all, he'll make sure it finds its way to the core. A small team (Stevan Little, Jesse Luehrs, and other contributors) is actively developping p5-mop, and Stevan is regularly blogging about it.If you want more details about the failing first attempt, there is a bunch of backlog and mailing lists archive to read. However, here is how Stevan would summarize it:We started the first prototype, not remembering the old adage of \"write the first one to throw away\" and I got sentimentally attached to my choice of design approach.

Until the mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about 505 million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular.

We have had them in the past, but they stay for a year or two years and then they look elsewhere,\" Mr Mehta says. Indian rugby remains fully amateur - with power centred around just two clubs - one in Kolkata and another in Mumbai. Both are members-only establishments - set up way back under British rule.

A smarter city may mean one that uses data on traffic to ease congestion or one that aims to join up services to provide better information for citizens. For many it is about making cities greener and more efficient. Technology firms such such as IBM and Cisco see smart cities as a huge business opportunity but, alongside the schemes being touted by technology firms, are more grass root projects which aim to empower citizens and allow them a say in how the city will look. Here, we look at some of the most talked-about projects: Songdo in South Korea, is - for many - the poster boy of the smart city. The $35bn (\u00c2\u00a323bn) project, located on reclaimed land near the Yellow Sea, was widely considered to be a model for smart cities around the globe when it was started in 2005. Also known as a ubiquitous city or U-city, Songdo's information systems are all linked to each other. It has led critics to dub it a \"city in a box\" - a showcase for technology but not necessarily the ideal city for people. Sensors are on everything in Songdo - for example, escalators only move when someone is on them. Every home has a telepresence system built in like a dishwasher. As well as allowing users to control the heating systems and locks, it offers video conferencing and is intended as a way to deliver education, health care and government services. Offices and schools are also connected to the network. The digital mastermind behind Songdo is Cisco, which supplies all the network-based technologies. The city is due for completion in 2015, by which time it will be home to 65,000 people and 300,000 workers. Masdar, which means \"source\" in Arabic,  is a city that stands in the middle of the desert of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. It is designed to be one of the most sustainable on the planet.

Group profit before tax rose 44.3% to 4.6bn euros (\u00c2\u00a33.9bn), one of the carmaker's highest quarterly results to date. Meanwhile, the group's troubled flagship brand also saw profits surge. Volkswagen brand operating profits rose to 869m euros from 73m euros the year before, although accounting changes meant sales revenues declined 24% to 19bn euros. Investors have said a turnaround at VW's namesake brand, which has had high fixed and research and development costs, is key to turning it into a more appealing business, although VW last year overtook Toyota as the world's biggest selling carmaker. Since the VW diesel emissions scandal broke in 2015, the group has made a number of structural changes. These include streamlining vehicle development, cutting material costs by reducing complexity in parts, dropping unprofitable models and shifting more power to brands and regions to respond more quickly to market needs. \"Our efforts to improve efficiency and productivity across all areas"}

And eventually you'll be able to talk to them as if they were your mates. \"Could you transfer \u00a3100 to my brother, please?\" you might one day ask your bank. Or maybe, \"Do you have any blue shirts in my size?\" Sometimes they'll ask you things too, with something like: \"Do you want to hear today's top stories?\" Right now the conversations will be structured - with Messenger bots suggesting things you can say. But the goal is natural conversation, and it could be a huge step. If what Facebook has promised today at its F8 developer conference comes to pass, the effect on our everyday lives could be enormous. It could be, according to Facebook's head of messaging David Marcus, a return to more personal interactions. \"Before the internet era, everything was conversational,\" he told the BBC. \"But then we traded conversations for scale.\" One of the bots being launched on the service today will be from Spring, an artificially intelligent concierge service. \"Spring is actually going to build an experience where everything is automated except customer service,\" Mr Marcus explained. \"It's bot for 99.9%, but then if you have a problem, a human can actually jump in and sort out your problem. \"That's the best of both worlds.\" There are obvious concerns to all this, and I'll get to those in a second, but first here's how it will work. Messenger Platform, as Facebook calls it, is the firm's latest application programming interface (API). An API is a way for companies like Facebook to give external developers the access and know-how to make things on their platforms. It's a big opportunity - the company's first API, which allowed anyone to create apps on Facebook, led to the birth of multi-billion dollar companies including Farmville creator, Zynga. There are already bots on Facebook - you can book an Uber through it in the US, for instance - but the crucial news today is anyone is now free to make their own bot. Which "}

All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. However, it is seldom every seen on cable.

The old definitions of cancer - breast, prostate, lung - are crumbling. Cancer starts with a mutation that turns a normal cell into one that divides uncontrollably and becomes a tumour. However, huge numbers of mutations can result in cancer and different mutations need different treatments. Research into the genetics of breast cancer means it is now thought of as at least 10 completely separate diseases, each with a different life expectancy and needing a different treatment.

But Shakespeare's Globe on London's Bankside is a kind of living laboratory, with its own team of in-house scholars, researchers and academic advisers. Everything from the physical design of the theatre through to the individual performances is informed by the insights and research work of academics The Globe's site beside the River Thames now has two theatres, with the opening of an indoor Jacobean theatre alongside the existing thatch-roofed, open-air playhouse. Building this much smaller, enclosed theatre, called the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, was an academic challenge in itself. Farah Karim-Cooper, one of the Globe's resident scholars, says that it's not a replica of a specific playhouse of the era, but a building assembled from different pieces of architectural evidence and contemporary sources. The design, a wooden candle-lit chamber, with some of the audience practically on stage, is the result of \"informed, rigorous speculation, based on all the available evidence\". But this doesn't mean an obsessive interest in re-creating \"authenticity\", says Dr Karim-Cooper. The buildings, like the performances, are about a living, breathing engagement with modern audiences. \"We're not interested in re-enactment,\" she says. But she considers the theatre an experiment in seeing how things work in practice. Like how do you move a play from the operatic scale of outdoor theatre to the close-up intimacy of the indoor theatre? It was something that happened regularly in Shakespeare's day, taking plays from the outdoor Globe to an indoor playhouse such as the Blackfriars, built in the atmospheric ruins of a monastery on the other side of the River Thames. It must have been like a rock band switching from a festival stage to a nightclub. The Globe was playing in daylight to open-air crowds, while the indoor theatre was a smaller, much wealthier audience, watching close-up in candlelight. The Globe team researched different types of candles, with beeswax chosen over tallow for the warmth of the light. And in terms of lighting effects, the indoor theatre has pulley-operated candelabra - or else the actors themselves carry candles. Light and "}

Within a year, they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team. This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM, a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy (such as the films of Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and others). In fact, up until they left for Columbia, MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles--including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY. And, oddly, in this film they didn't act as a team--they just did various supporting roles, such as Larry playing the piano!<br /><br />This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle.

She even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter (not her father!) Yet her Radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field.

The distinction is crucial because employees are entitled to a raft of benefits. It could strengthen the case for Uber drivers currently taking legal action against the company. The ruling emerged in court documents published by a lawyer representing the drivers - all based in San Francisco. The California Employment Development Department (EDD) determined that a former Uber driver in southern California was an employee, not an independent contractor as the company had claimed. Uber appealed against the decision, but both appeals were rejected - by an administrative law judge and then by the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. The EDD decision is the third such ruling on the status of Uber - which has quickly become a huge issue for the company. Back in May, a Florida regulatory agency also agreed that drivers were employees, as did the California Labour Commissioner in June. "}

He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa.

Credit Agricole, which has a 14.6% stake BES, said second quarter net income was 705m euros compared with profits last year of 1.3bn euros. \"We can only regret having been misled by the family with which Credit Agricole was trying to create a true partnership to build the biggest private bank in Portugal,\" CA's chief executive Jean-Paul Chifflet said. Mr Chifflet added that Credit Agricole was closely following investigations and audits underway at BES. Credit Agricole reserves the right to take legal action should any issues arise out of the probes, a spokeswoman for the bank said. \"The new management [of BES] has indicated that it would consider taking legal action, and we will take part,\" Mr Chifflet told journalists.

Analysis Nigel Cassidy, BBC Europe business reporter With so much unfinished business when it comes to rationalising, refinancing and regulating EU banks, this latest and severe collateral damage to Credit Agricole is a reminder that it's not just known troubled lenders that have to bite the bullet, declare write-downs and clean up their balance sheets."}

Cummings was the supplier again as captain David Gray squeezed in a header early in the second half. With nearest challengers Falkirk drawing at home to St Mirren, Neil Lennon's men cannot be caught with three games remaining. A crowd of 17,056 turned up for the Easter Road party, ending a period of three seasons in the second tier for the Edinburgh club. Having drawn four of their past five games, there was no sign of any malaise as the hosts started in whirlwind fashion, with John McGinn and Martin Boyle having early chances. But the Dumfries side showed they were not simply making up the numbers as Dominic Thomas fired just wide from 18 yards. The breakthrough came on 13 minutes as McGinn floated a free-kick to the back post, where McGregor sent a header arcing over the outstretched arms of Lee Robinson and into the net. It was the centre-half's first goal of the season and the huge home support roared their approval. They were then infuriated by referee Barry Cook, who called back play when Cummings was clean through on goal. Queens midfielder John Rankin was booked for a challenge on Andrew Shinnie but, rather than playing advantage, Cook blew his whistle. The visitors almost drew level when former Hibee Stephen Dobbie got on the end of a mishit shot by Thomson, but Ofir Marciano pulled off a magnificent stop. Robinson then denied the home side a second with a wonderful save from a Boyle shot but, moments later, Lennon's side doubled their advantage. Cummings sent in a corner that was met by the right boot of McGregor for his and his team's second of the day. The home side continued to drive forward and scored number three just after the break.

Nevertheless, socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties. Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong \"colonial\" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century. In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate. Later"}

Button, ever the politician, tried to put the situation into perspective. \"In two weeks' time,\" he said, \"we could go to a race and be fighting for fifth and sixth place and we probably wouldn't be having this conversation.\" So how can Alonso and Button be fighting for 15th and 16th places in Italy, but also hope to be half a field's worth of positions better off in Singapore next weekend? Let's look at the problems McLaren - and particularly Honda - have and try to explain. It is no secret that McLaren's biggest issue is the lack of competitiveness of the Honda engine, in the Japanese company's first season back in Formula 1 since 2008. Alonso laid the situation bare at the weekend, revealing information from the GPS speed traces used by teams to analyse how they compare to their rivals. \"There are so many areas we need to improve,\" the two-time champion said, \"but on a circuit that has six corners, on the GPS, we lose two or three tenths in those corners. The rest of the three seconds we need to find on the straights.\" To understand why this is so bad at high-speed Monza, but will have less of an effect on Singapore's streets, we need to explain the specifics of Honda's struggles with the turbo hybrid engine rules introduced into F1 in 2014. It's going to get a bit technical, but please bear with us - it's worth it. F1 engines are 1.6-litre V6 turbos with two separate but inter-linked hybrid elements recovering and redeploying energy that would otherwise be wasted. There is an electric motor linked to the rear axle - the MGU-K - which recovers kinetic energy during braking and stores it in a battery for use later. Power deployed from the battery via the \"K\" is limited to 120kw. There is a second electric motor - called the MGU-H (for heat) -  which recovers energy from the turbocharger. The regulations do not impose a limit on how much energy is deployed to the wheels from this and so it can be considered as 'free' energy. Honda's fundamental problem is that it cannot harvest enough energy to deploy along the entire length of all but the shortest of straights.

Caught in a classic liquidity trap, for example, the option of designing monetary policy to hit specific inflation targets would be difficult, in part because a sudden, sharp devaluation of the yen would put enormous pressure on South Korea and Taiwan to devalue their currencies. In an era of global capital flows, the constant national need to make adjustments in the value of key currencies, and the costs of overshooting, misalignment, and potential speculative attack have enormously complicated domestic macroeconomic management.Global Capital Flows: Japan's rapid growth from 1955-1975 and its steady growth from 1975-1991 can be understood as part of a global expansion of trade.

Some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `Committed,' starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. Her name is Joline, and this is her story.<br /><br />\tAdmittedly, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is, someone forgot to tell Carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he's gone; off to `find' himself and figure it all out. When Joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. Maybe it's because of that `clay' she's made of.

Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1. Macrophages also act as scavengers, ridding the body of worn-out cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system."}

Other days, other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment, made in 1992 with Alfred Molina, Joan Plowright, Polly Walker, Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Kitchens in the major roles. Under the brush stroke direction of Mike Newell, these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter's eye.

Called An Linne: Echoes, Reflections and Transfigurations, the events mark the centenary of the artist's birth in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1916. The painter, who served as a navigator on US bombers flown out of England during World War Two, moved to Mallaig in 1957 and he continued to visit and work in the village in the north-west Highlands throughout his career. Many of his pieces were influenced by the changing weather on the west coast and the effect the conditions had on the sea.

The ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection."}

The woman he was referring to was Deann Siden, reports ProWrestling.net. She was arrested in May of 2003 for stalking the couple and is also believed to have stalked Ric Flair as well. Apparently, Siden left numerous phone messages stating that she was having Kurt's baby and also threatened Karen during that time period. At the time of the incident, Angle denied the affair.

A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \"distributive efficiency\" within society, that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amount of wealth in society, a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies have found evidence for this theory, noting that in societies where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher."}

Anti-government protesters have been marching through the capital, saying they will shut it down until their demands are met. They accuse her government of being under the control of her brother, ousted former leader Thaksin Shinawatra. They say they want an unelected \"People's Council\" instead, to reform the electoral system. The rice purchase scheme was launched in 2011, with the aim of boosting farmers' incomes and helping alleviate rural poverty. But it has resulted in the accumulation of huge stockpiles of rice, which the government cannot sell. The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) says it is looking into Ms Yingluck's role in the scheme, and investigating her for possible negligence of duty. \"Those who oversaw the scheme knew there were losses but did not put a stop to it,\" NACC spokesman Vicha Mahakhun told a news conference. As prime minister, Ms Yingluck is nominally the head of the National Rice Committee. Farmers have traditionally been some of Ms Yingluck's most ardent supporters. Her Pheu Thai Party was helped to power in 2011 by offering to buy rice at above the market price.

In the UK, 5.2 million homes are in flood risk zones but only 1.7 million of these have had flood prevention measures installed. The lack of action is partly the result of people being unaware that they live in a flood risk zone. It is also because householders do not believe it could happen to them. But, during last winter, it did for thousands of people, including Mr and Mrs Brice. They had to wait four months before the house was certified as dry enough for works to begin. So far only four of the property's 11 rooms have been renovated. While their insurance company has covered the cost of restoring their home, the Brices have invested in specialist flood proofing materials. They have to pick up the bill for these additions themselves. \"All these measures should mean that if there is a flood again it will be a clean up operation not a total evacuation and rebuild,\" says Mrs Brice. The partition walls have all been rebuilt with flood resistant insulation - fibre glass absorbs flood water and must be replaced if it gets wet. In addition, the beams are water treated and the plaster board being used is a specialist anti-flood form of gypsum. All the floors are now marine ply with an Amtico covering. Beyond using anti-flood, mould resistant materials, the Brices decided to increase the floor heights of their home as well. \"We've lifted our floors by nearly 25cm,\" says Mrs Brice. \"It means we have had to lift the heights of all our windows and doors as well but it gives us peace of mind. \"The windows have cost \u00a34,000 to fix.

From the age of five, I was playing football in the back garden with my brothers. When I was growing up, there wasn't the opportunity for a girl like me to play football for a team or a club. Being from a South Asian background, me playing football was seen as taboo, especially within the Asian community. Muslim girls were encouraged to play sports but not alongside boys and it was preferred that we played indoor sports like netball or badminton which took place in enclosed environments. When I played football, I wore shorts - even that was frowned upon and raised eyebrows. I played alongside other girls at school but I enjoyed playing the game with boys. There was a lack of opportunity and so much negativity, I gave up playing at the age of 14. I was heartbroken and angry at the same time. I felt like an outsider within my own community. I never lost my passion for the game though - I would still take my ball down the park for a kickabout and I always watched football on TV. But"}

Back pain is a leading cause of disability and in the UK alone it is estimated to affect 26 million people each year. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which establishes best NHS practice, currently recommends paracetamol for both lower back pain and for osteoarthritis. However, questions have been raised about the quality of the evidence which led to the decisions. A team at the University of Sydney assessed data from 13 drug trials involving more than 5,000 patients. They concluded that paracetamol was \"ineffective\" at reducing back pain. In osteoarthritis in the hip or knee, they found a small improvement with paracetamol. Yet the impact was so small it was \"not clinically important\". Gustavo Machado, one of the researchers, argued: \"Paracetamol is the most widely used over-the counter medicine for musculoskeletal conditions so it is critical that we review treatment recommendations in light of this new evidence. \"In our research, paracetamol for low back pain and osteoarthritis was also shown to be associated with higher risk of liver toxicity in patients. \"Patients were nearly "}

Others crafted varied experiences, strolling the grounds and seeking out musicians behind trees, next to grave markers, and atop hills.The instruments were as diverse as the crowd, and as the musicians, drawn from all over the region.

Financial constraints limited his ambitions at Shamrock Rovers and while he was the brainchild behind Sporting Fingal's creation, he was powerless to prevent their implosion.This then, is his season of redemption. Having rebuilt this Pat's team over a two-year-period, he has suddenly seen them mature into winners. Last night, they had questions asked about their nerve after UCD took a 23rd minute lead, yet they answered them.Within 10 minutes of the warning lights flashing, they had claimed the lead, Chris Forrester being the scorer of one goal and creator of another.

Long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with. The climax of the story does not touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone.

Now, SanDisk has taken an interest Diablo Technologies and has partnered with the company to release a shipping product.Dubbed ULLtra DIMM (Ultra Low Latency), the company has already signed IBM to ship the new hardware in System x3850 and x3950 X6 servers, with up to 12.8TB of installed flash capacity. The reason IBM is pushing ahead to adopt the modules, as Diablo Technologies indicated to us back last summer, is latency. Early benchmarks show that eXFlash (IBM's only-slightly-better name for the tech) hitting a write latency of 5-10 microseconds \u2014 far lower than anything else in the NAND industry. The listed performance, per DIMM, is 1GB/sec read and 750MB/sec write.The market for these DIMMs is high-frequency stock trading \u2014 SanDisk mentions virtual desktop interfaces, transaction processing, cloud computing, and virtualization, but most of these workloads aren't so latency critical as to demand 5-10 microsecond response times. HFT, on the other hand, is a market where microseconds in response time really can make the difference between making and losing money on a trade.

At the moment, it isn't available with 64GB of on-board storage. It will be going on sale in China on 16th December and there's still no word of its international availability. For those craving for a 4G handset, the Redmi Note 4G is the only option right now and it is going on sale today for RM589.To recap on the specs, the Xiaomi Mi 4 features a 5\u2033 Full HD display and it runs on a high-end 2.5GHz Quad-Core Snapdragon 801 processor with 3GB of RAM. The on-board storage is non-expandable like the previous Mi 3. For imaging, it gets an improved"}

The tests matched the samples with the DNA of an ancient polar bear. But two other scientists have said re-analysis of the same data shows the hairs belong to the Himalayan bear, a sub-species of the brown bear. The results of the new research by Ceiridwen Edwards and Ross Barnett have been published in the Royal Society journal, Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Among Dr Edwards' previous work was an attempt to carry out DNA analysis of a sample taken from bones of a polar bear washed into caves in north west Scotland 18,000 years ago. According to legend, the yeti is a large and elusive ape-like beast. For many years experts have been seeking a scientific explanation for the Abominable Snowman. Prof Sykes, along with other genetics experts, conducted DNA tests on hairs from two unidentified animals, one from Ladakh - in northern India on the west of the Himalayas - and the other from Bhutan, 800 miles (1,285km) further east. The results were then compared with the genomes of other animals stored on a database of all published DNA sequences. The scientists found that he had a 100% match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in Svalbard, Norway, that dates back to between 40,000 and 120,000 years ago - a time when the polar bear and closely-related brown bear were separating as different species. The species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap. The sample from Ladakh came from the mummified remains of a creature shot by a hunter around 40 years ago, while the second sample was in the form of a "}

The UK referendum campaign is now in full swing, ahead of the British in-out vote in June on whether to stay in the EU. It has totally overshadowed the Dutch referendum. But the geopolitical stakes are high in the EU agreement with Ukraine. The ultimate aim is to integrate the ex-Soviet republic into the EU's internal market - and Russia is hostile to it. Supporters see it as a key step to draw Ukraine out of Russia's orbit but Eurosceptics say it goes too far, too fast. Under a new Dutch law, more than 300,000 signatures are required to secure a referendum. Once the signatures have been verified, the vote must be held within six months. Next month's vote is the first under the new law, which was designed to improve Dutch democracy by giving citizens a bigger say. A leading No campaigner, Thierry Baudet, said: \"This is a chance to say we're here too, the most important thing is to finally give the Dutch people a vote on the continuous expansion and increase of powers of the European Union.\" He accused the EU of \"reckless geopolitical moves\". An association agreement must be ratified by all EU member states. So could a No vote by the Dutch block the deal?

Not only does the T-cell extend a vitamin D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function.

I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slower-moving, was not as episodic, and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third movie.<br /><br />It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole. I have heard many strange reasons such as: a) Because Yoda died b) Because Bobba Fett died c) Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d) Because Darth Vader was revealed<br /><br />I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely. First off, WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died??? If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die. Don't get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas' intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be. His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie... You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fett's name!!! Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think... Secondly, many fans did not like Yoda dying. Sure, it was a momentous period in the movie. I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic.

But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season. Then we have The Sopranos. I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season, and more importantly all of its episodes. There is no department that this show doesn't excel in. Acting- Nothing short of superb. James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode, after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would've been the better choice, however after watching the first few episodes, i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony.

Star Trek is about our future, not one in a galaxy far, far away, but right here on Earth with our history and values.To watch Star Trek is to wonder not only what might be possible one day, but also what we can do now to get closer to a Federation-like future. With more than 40 years of television and film carefully considered, Trek fans understand the hard work and difficult questions we must face if we are ever to make real life as prosperous as the 23rd and 24th Centuries.One such question is that of security, particularly our comfort level with security measures that may impact our other values, such as privacy or human rights. Today, we are wrestling with this balance in America and around the world. It has been at the heart of recent debates over things like the controversial NSA Prism program, which detractors equate to limitless wire-tapping of citizens, or the release of classified military information on sites like WikiLeaks.In the midst of these complex issues is perhaps the most visible national security case in recent memory, that of U.S. Army Soldier Chelsea Manning "}

The lot of France's 240,000 police and gendarmes is certainly not a happy one. Since jihadist terror struck Paris in November they have been on extra duties for the post-attacks state of emergency. Holidays were cancelled, unpaid overtime is accumulating. Add to that the migrant camps near Calais, which have required several companies of riot police. Plus: And then on Monday came the shocking news of two officers murdered by an Islamist in Magnanville, west of Paris. It is small wonder that many officers feel they are at the end of their tether. President Francois Hollande recognises the strains. At Friday's ceremony in Versailles for the murdered police couple, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing and Jessica Schneider, he paid tribute to the dedication of the service. And he said he would meet some of the demands of police unions to ensure their better protection. For example, even after the state of emergency runs out next month, officers will continue to be allowed to carry handguns when off duty.  And there will be extra, so far unspecified, measures to safeguard police anonymity. The greatest fear after Monday's murders is that lone-wolf Islamists will target police officers whom they have come up against personally in the past as petty criminals. \"We've all at one time or another had contracts put on our heads by robbers or gang-leaders,\" says Olivier Berton of the Alliance union. \"Regularly they send out juniors to check out the cars parked outside the police station, to get the registration numbers.\" Officers are now under standing instructions not to wear uniform when off duty, not"}

Still, it's very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. There's also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. The surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey.

Under the deal the US will cede control of Bagram over six months. Reports say they will retain access and be able to block the release of certain detainees. Handing over US-run jails has been a key demand of Afghan President Hamid Karzai ahead of Nato's withdrawal. Analysts say the issue has cast a shadow over negotiations on Nato's withdrawal of all of its combat forces by the end of 2014 and the long-term relationship with Afghanistan. Bagram prison, officially known as the Parwan Detention Centre, is located in one of the largest military bases for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan. It has been at the centre of a number of prisoner abuse allegations in recent years. Nato is also under intense pressure after days of protests and targeted killings across Afghanistan - over the inadvertent burning of Korans at Bagram - left at least 30 people dead. The US repeatedly apologised over the incident but that failed to quell public anger. Correspondents say the deal is the first stage of a mechanism which is still being worked out but will eventually see US-run jails handed over to full Afghan control.

Two guys (one naive and one loud mouthed a**) take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky, make-shift tank/truck hybrid decides to play cat-and-mouse with them. Things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker. What makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie, unlike so many others. The two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase/suspense scenes. Nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror/slasher buff.

Experts say attempting so-called \"gay cures\" can be \"dangerous\" and \"damaging\". Fourteen organisations, including NHS England, have signed an agreement to stop gay conversion therapy being offered to patients. Although in general, referrals to conversion services are rare - there is evidence that GPs, counsellors and psychotherapists have made them. They will also be providing training for staff to enable them to improve support available to lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people seeking advice. The agreement, The Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK, makes it clear that NHS England, the organisation which has day-to-day responsibility for running the NHS, \"does not endorse or support conversion therapy\" and will make this clear to staff. It essentially means GPs will not be able to refer patients for gay therapy and that no-one employed by the NHS can provide it. Amber Dowell, communications officer at the UK Council for Psychotherapy, told Newsbeat the agreement was \"really important\". \"It's very common for people to have feelings where they might question their sexuality, where they might want to explore the attractions they're feeling. \"We want people to be able to do that in an environment that is safe, supportive and free of judgement.\" There are no official figures for how many people attempt conversion therapy every year, but the Department of Health has acknowledged to Newsbeat it does occasionally happen. Amber suggested that an \"ignorance of the issue of the ethics involved\" rather than staff being \"prejudiced against LGB people\" was to blame for it being offered by the NHS in the past. \"I think, in trying to help people mistakenly, referrals had been made in the past,\" she said.

I have spent the last 4 weeks doing a ton of research into the way Physx works and the CPU/GPU utilization aspect. Ideally I would like to hire someone to work on the Physx aspect of the game since i am not proficient in coding, and in the meantime, I am learning how to do this myself. Specifically, I want someone to decode and edit the .dll and the .bin files in the game directory and change any calls or strings and maybe some float lines to make fluid and particle effects work better on multi threaded hardware. The end goal is for me and everyone else to finally have a fix for the low fps when Physx is being utilised. I will be updating this thread as I come across more info.

Lee stated: \"Homophobia is bigotry. Do you support bigotry?\" to which Powell replied: \"This isn't homophobia, this is God's word.\" He went on to accuse Powell of not understanding what bigotry was. The preacher and former prison worker, who was claiming constructive dismissal, was also on the show and was told by Lee: \"I find the view that being gay is sinful, I find that view completely repugnant and disgraceful.\" Following the show, the BBC issued a statement to LGBT website Pink News apologising for any offence that may have been caused.

Wildlife enthusiasts have been working with electricity firm Scottish Power to make overhead lines safer for large birds such as ospreys and buzzards. Man-made osprey nests are also being put up to deter the birds from perching on wooden electricity poles. \"I just felt that this can't be allowed to happen again,\" said volunteer Gail Edgley, who has been co-ordinating the work. The modifications to power lines are taking place in areas where the birds have been known to nest or hunt for fishing. It involves moving the wires further apart, fitting rings on the lines to deter birds and making it harder for them to perch on transformer boxes which supply homes. Liam O'Sullivan from Scottish Power said: \"The death of the osprey in May was the first fatality that I can ever recall in our north Wales district. \"We wanted to act quickly to help to prevent any future incidents.\" Hear more on Country Focus, BBC Radio Wales, Sunday 18 October, 07:00 BST.

But, in order to actually understand this definition, we will have to cover a few concepts first. At the end, we will also illustrate the concepts we learned in the context of StackPHP with some example code. This usually makes things much easier to understand.What is the HttpKernelInterface?--ADVERTISEMENT--The HttpKernelInterface can be defined as more than one thing. At its most basic level, it is a PHP interface found inside the Symfony HttpKernel component. But it is more than that. It is a modern PHP pattern that allows us to treat HTTP requests in an object oriented way instead of dealing with superglobals and output functions like echo or header .But what does this actually mean?The interface provides a single method called handle() that accepts a $request and is expected to return a $response . The latter are basically wrapper objects around the HTTP specification. For example, in Symfony, it is the responsibility of the HttpFoundation component to create and manage these. So as you can imagine, the $request object contains data about the current user request, while the $response object is responsible for"}

Let's run through them individually while we have a moment:Expanded game rosters: At the moment, teams must deactivate seven of their 53 players on game day. That 46-man limit created problems on a number of occasions last season, notably as it related to depth in games on short rest. So the Washington Redskins have proposed allowing 49 active players for games not scheduled on Sunday or Monday (i.e., Thursday). The purpose of game-day deactivations is to give opposing teams an equal number of available players -- typically each has a different number of moderate injuries that require a week off but not a trip to injured reserve -- but 46 cuts it pretty tight. I would love to see 49 for all games, as would most coaches, but making the adjustment for Thursday night games would be a good start.Bigger practice squads: Last season, as we discussed at the time, the NFL seemed to "}

Late on a Friday evening, he was brought by the police to Antrim's ED in a distressed state. They had found him in his car desperately needing medical assistance.

Both must now get themselves into their final positions. Noteworthy is the fact that ViaSat-2 and 172B will be using electric engines to do this. These work by accelerating and expelling ions at high speed. The process provides less thrust than a standard chemical engine, but saves substantially on propellant mass. That saving can be traded to get either a lower-priced launch ticket, or to pack even greater capacity into the satellite's communications payload for no additional weight.

Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O 2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O 2 by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum, the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet. Near the Earth's surface, it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust. The metastable molecule tetraoxygen (O 4) was discovered in 2001, and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen. It was proven in 2006 that this phase, created by pressurizing O 2 to 20 GPa, is in fact a rhombohedral O 8 cluster. This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O 2 or O 3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel. A metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen"}

Therefore, we designed MagC to match your MacBook beautifully.Since 2006, MagSafe, a magnetic power connector, has protected numerous MacBooks from flying off the table and suffering from terminal damage. Connecting the cable was as easy as a snap. Gently tug it - it breaks off cleanly.However, in 2016, MagSafe was removed from all new products, replaced by USB-C, the new industrial standard. We decided that we need to bring back MagSafe, we need to bring back one of the most enduring designs of Steve Jobs. So, we work relentlessly to design MagC.In order to support data transfer, video output and charging with LED indicator while minimising its size, we make use of a 0.8mm thick 4 layered PCB board.

There should be no paid prioritisation system that slowed services if they did not pay a fee, he added. Official plans to end net neutrality and let firms run fast and slow lanes for data have generated wide debate in the US. More than three million comments about the proposed change were lodged with the US regulator overseeing the debate. However, the president's intervention has been criticised by internet service providers and some Republican politicians. \"Net neutrality is Obamacare for the internet,\" said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is aligned with the conservative Tea Party wing of the Republicans. \"It puts the government in charge of determining internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered.\" \"We cannot allow internet service providers to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas,\" said President Obama in a video statement on the issue. He said net neutrality had been built into the \"fabric\" of the net since its creation and had been essential to its growth and continuing influence. He called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \"answer the call\" heard in the millions of comments left on its website in support of net neutrality and implement \"the strongest possible rules\" to protect the principle. Net neutrality revolves around the idea that ISPs should not be allowed to manipulate the data flowing to their customers. The FCC is considering changing rules governing data traffic, following a court ruling in January that allowed ISP Verizon to charge to carry traffic from bandwidth-heavy services such as Netflix.

The move has added to Qatar's isolation over its support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other allied Islamist groups in the region, who in recent months have seen the gains they made in the Arab Spring rolled back. BBC correspondents around the region describe below how Qatar is now viewed For the best part of a year, Qatar's neighbours had banked on avoiding this escalation. They had hoped the new Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, would offer a change from what they considered deeply unpopular policies in Libya, Syria, Egypt and Tunisia. They had wanted a return to the days when the Arabian Peninsula's most powerful rulers worked together to resolve crises rather than exacerbate them. The message received by Qatar's neighbours was that change was on its way. But, similar to when Mohammed Morsi ruled in Egypt, a perception grew of failure to fulfil promises. Now those divisions are, unusually for the Gulf, laid bare in public. The Emiratis and Saudis see members of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists as \"terrorists\" threatening their ways of life, along with those of Bahrainis and Egyptians. The Qataris are accused of playing host to them and broadcasting anti-UAE sermons by one of their key figures. People here are dumbfounded as to why Qatar has nailed its colours to the Brotherhood and other Islamist groups' masts in the first place. Warning shots were fired when the UAE's foreign minister summoned the Qatari ambassador to Abu Dhabi and an alleged Brotherhood \"cell\" was put behind bars. This high-profile joint action between Cairo, Riyadh, Manama and Abu Dhabi is the latest attempt to change Qatar's behaviour. But if the withdrawal of ambassadors, broadcasters and columnists from Doha does not get the message across, these political differences could tear apart valuable and important economic and security ties between the neighbours. No-one is seriously predicting that yet, but the government here remains tight-lipped about how far it thinks this row will go.

The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced.

The raw transaction API gives you a lot of power and flexibility, but it's also more cumbersome and, if used incorrectly, you can accidentally lose lots of money.Why do those features need the raw transaction API?The raw transaction API is useful for a few reasons. First, it lets you create and sign transactions independently from broadcasting them. That means you can create and sign a name_firstupdate transaction before its preceding name_new transaction has been broadcast. Second, it gives you direct control over the inputs, outputs, and fees for the transaction, whereas the standard name commands instead pick defaults for you that you might not like and can't change.What's wrong with Namecoin Core's raw transaction API?It's not raw "}

While Drive is connected to the entire Google Apps (now known as G Suite) ecosystem, Dropbox is a lightweight, simple alternative for file storage. While both are useful, users need to look beyond features, and make sure the service they choose can adequately protect their data. Here's how Dropbox encryption and Google Drive encryption stack up.Dropbox and Google Drive EncryptionTo their credit, both Dropbox and Google Drive protect user files with encryption. Both also allow users to enable two-step verification, which requires an extra code texted to the user's phone to access the account, making it harder for hackers to access a user's data. Finally, both services use perfect forward secrecy, which prevents hackers from using old session keys to hack files stored in the cloud.Dropbox encryption uses 256-bit AES keys to protect files at rest, and encrypts data in motion with 128-bit AES SSL/TLS encryption or better. Google Drive encryption is similar; files in motion are protected using 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption, while those at rest are encrypted with 128-bit AES keys.Dropbox and Google Security VulnerabilitiesBoth Google Drive encryption and Dropbox Encryption have faced security exploits and threats in the past.

Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting \"\"f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth! All those other movies are bullsh**!\"\"<br /><br />Well anyway, I didn't even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when I read the tagline for the film, \"\"You've heard the laws side of the story...now hear the story as it is told by the Manson Family.\"\" Excuse me, if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn't want to have anything to do with, how in God's name can he tell the story for them!?

Brown went 14-for-22 for 155 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Tyrone Walker and Lechein Neblett each finished with four receptions to pace the receivers.

You properly have one of the best long distance kickers in the world,\" he wrote. \"A friend of mine found a football with your club name on by the seaside. \"It has travelled quite a distance. We are located 1,800km (1,118 miles) north of Aberdeen, on an island called Vanna, 10km [six miles] north of Tromso, the capital of North Norway. \"The football is just a little bit dirty after such a long distance, but "}

France begins to clear migrant camp Child migrants arrive at 'respite centre' Live reports of the Jungle clearance What next after the Jungle? Addressing MPs, Mrs Rudd said the children chosen to come to the UK would be selected on the basis of three factors - how likely they were to be granted refugee status, whether they were aged 12 years or under, and whether they were at high risk of sexual exploitation. Britain will not consider any children who arrive in the Jungle after the process of clearance began, she added, to discourage more from travelling to Calais. She told the Commons, 800 children had already been interviewed by UK officials in the camp - saying some interviews with children had to be \"paused\" for staff safety reasons. Between \"200 to 300 more\" would be interviewed in the coming weeks, she said, but added that not all of them would come to the UK. Almost 200 children had been brought to the UK so far, including those with family connections in the UK - under the EU-wide Dublin arrangement - as well as vulnerable children - under the Dubs amendment. She indicated that unaccompanied refugee children will not be allowed to sponsor their parents to come and join them in the UK.

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below)."}

Publishing Ofsted's annual report, Sir Michael warned of a growing north-south divide in standards in secondary schools. But he raised particular concerns about Bradford, where he said schools were in the lowest-achieving 10 authorities at both primary and secondary level. And he warned that schools in the city \"remain mired in mediocrity, failing generation after generation with depressing regularity\". Of the 100,000 pupils in Bradford's schools, he said 40,000 were in schools rated as \"less than good\" and 8,000 of these were in schools labelled as \"inadequate\". The Ofsted chief is calling for a commissioner to run education in the city. In the wake of the Trojan Horse controversy a commissioner was created to oversee education in Birmingham. Sir Michael warned of the risks of a weak education system. \"If children are poorly educated, they don't go to university, they don't get apprenticeships, they don't get jobs. \"Educational underperformance leads directly to social alienation,\" said Sir Michael.

The IPCC investigated the circumstances of the crash, including examining CCTV and in-car video footage. Nine officers and one member of police staff were served notice that their conduct was under investigation by the IPCC. One officer has since had six penalty points placed on his police driving licence. A headset used in the control room during the pursuit was also found to be faulty, according to the report. At the time of the collision several police vehicles were involved in the pursuit of the 19-year-old's Ford Fiesta which involved speeds of up to 100mph. The pursuit started when Mr Seddon, who was driving on a provisional licence without insurance, failed to stop for an officer. Mr Seddon, who had not been wearing a seat belt, was thrown into the road and hit by one of the pursuing vehicles.

Some settlers landed in present-day Chesterfield County. On 12 May 1705, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act to naturalise the 148 Huguenots still resident at Manakintown. Of the original 390 settlers in the isolated settlement, many had died; others lived outside town on farms in the English style; and others moved to different areas. Gradually they intermarried with their English neighbors. Through the 18th and 19th centuries, descendants of the French migrated west into the Piedmont, and across the Appalachian Mountains into the West of what became Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states. In the Manakintown area, the Huguenot Memorial Bridge across the James River and Huguenot Road were named in their honor, as were many local features, including several schools, including Huguenot High School."}

To explore genetic variation associated with CD in AJs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by combining raw genotype data across 10 AJ cohorts consisting of 907 cases and 2,345 controls in the discovery stage, followed up by a replication study in 971 cases and 2,124 controls.

Novel signals detected among AJs were mapped to chromosomes 5q21.1 (rs7705924, combined p = 2\u00d710 \u22128 ; combined odds ratio OR = 1.48), 2p15 (rs6545946, p = 7\u00d710 \u22129 ; OR = 1.16), 8q21.11 (rs12677663, p = 2\u00d710 \u22128 ; OR = 1.15), 10q26.3 (rs10734105, p = 3\u00d710 \u22128 ; OR = 1.27), and 11q12.1 (rs11229030, p = 8\u00d710 \u22129 ; OR = 1.15), implicating biologically plausible candidate genes, including RPL7, CPAMD8, PRG2, and PRG3. In all, the 16 replicated and newly discovered loci, in addition to the three coding NOD2 variants, accounted for 11.2% of the total genetic variance for CD risk in the AJ population. This "}

Below are players who 1) ranked in the nation's Top 50 in Passes Defended last year and 2) are returning in 2012. I simply took a look at the number of passes they defended per game in 2011 and projected how many interceptions they should have had if they had pulled in 21.9% of their passes defended. This comes with some obvious disclaimers: Not everybody has the same set of hands. Some defensive backs have great hands, while others are defensive backs (and not receivers) because their hands leave something to be desired.If we were to use this as \"projections\" for 2012 -- as in, how many passes might they intercept next year? -- we would have to assume that they will see the same number of passes in 2012. That might be a faulty assumption because, quite simply, you develop a reputation after a while. Players on this list got quite a few opportunities to prove what they could do.

The UK's debt is \"eye-wateringly\" large, he says. There are \"sharp\" challenges ahead and inflation is expected to rise next year. Some might say that Britain is itself just about managing. Marine engineer Christopher Harroway is already noticing a rise in the cost of living. \"You realise from daily activities like going to do your shopping, fuel prices, everything, that it's a lot higher than it used to be,\" he says. \"A lot of people's wages don't match that as much now. \"Life's hard at times, but I suppose you get by.\" Christopher works at Dunston's Ship Repairs in Hull, where he has been employed for 12 years. He hopes to buy a house in the next few years, but he knows the mortgage will be higher than his rent is currently. He, like many others, would appreciate some government help to bridge the gap. When the chancellor unveils his Autumn Statement on Wednesday we will get our first, proper detailed look at the policies this government wishes to pursue, its priorities. We know - because the prime minister tells us - that ministers are determined to make the lives of the Jams better. But there is limited money available to help voters left behind by globalisation, those whose living standards could be further eroded next year by falling growth and rising prices. Outside Dunston's, another ship is preparing to leave, as the sun starts to rise over the Humber, and more vessels are coming into port. People have struggled in Hull for decades, but now lives are improving after a huge effort to rebuild the economy around the renewable energy sector. \"We're very much on the right trajectory for the first time in something like 35 years.

However, the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime.

Sheikh Tamim inherited a country whose big ambitions at being a regional - even global - power were foundering. Its support for Islamist movements in revolutionary Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and Syria was backfiring, straining relations with Western allies and Gulf neighbours alike. Meanwhile at home, conservatives were increasingly vocal in the criticism of what they perceived to be the wholesale importation of Western cultural and educational institutions and values. But the new emir was fortunate because, despite spending hundreds of billions trying to fulfil a variety of ambitions, the state coffers remained full. By any economic measure Qatar is in a league of its own. With a small indigenous population - roughly 275,000 out of a total of 2 million - the country has the highest GDP per capita in the world and the lowest unemployment rate. In an energy-hungry world, it has massive reserves of hydrocarbons and highly-sophisticated infrastructure to deliver them to global markets. The country's sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, had assets worth more than $115bn (\u00c2\u00a370bn) at the end of 2012. With that sort of money at their disposal, one would expect the Qataris to \"spend, spend, spend\". And spend they have. Qatar has bought up banks all over the world, football clubs in Europe, and properties in the heart of London with some of the highest price tags on the planet. It has armed rebel groups seeking to topple the rulers of Libya and Syria, and poured billions of dollars into an ultimately futile attempt to shore up the government of Egypt's ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi. It has also set aside billions more to fund the the Qatar National Food Security Programme (QNFSP), which seeks to maximise "}

Nothing other than a questionable \"\"sequel\"\" to 8MM. It wasn't a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie.<br /><br />Basically, from the plot outline verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fianc\u00e9e, Tish Harrington, venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute, Risa. The entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city. The mystery is solved when, in the end, Tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and (essentially later on in the story) her fianc\u00e9e which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end.<br /><br />I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene. Otherwise, its a totally different movie. It made for a lousy love story, even before"}

They are divided into four classes (Type I \u2013 IV) based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages."}

It's decades since I read it, and one of the things I'd forgotten is how rounded a character Darcy is. In my mind, fed by at least three different television adaptations over the years, his early appearances are characterised by his unforgivable snobbishness, and dismissiveness of almost everything and everyone he encounters. In fact, it's much more complicated than that. And more interesting.Everybody \u2013 including me \u2013 thinks they know the arc of the storyline. It's as well-known, and as straightforward, as Romeo and Juliet, with mutual dislike replacing love at first sight. Wrong. There is dislike but, following a single disastrous evening, it is all on Elizabeth's side. She is the one whose pride is piqued, so that despite several days spent in the same house as Darcy \u2013 tell you later \u2013 she sees only hauteur and self-importance while Austen makes sure that the reader is seeing something quite different. She does this by telling us exactly what is going through Darcy's mind at crucial moments. I was astonished to realise that she makes it absolutely clear what is going on as early as Chapter 6. By their second meeting, following the famously awful first encounter in Chapter 4, he is finding her face 'rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes' and other discoveries 'equally mortifying' concerning her figure and easy manner.Meanwhile,"}

Aerial pictures have been made public to mark the Festival of Archaeology. Discoveries were made in Cumbria, Cambridgeshire, Dorset, East Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, West Sussex and West Midlands. Roman camps were temporary enclosures dug by troops on manoeuvres. The line marking out the buried camp can be seen as different colours in the crops across several fields. The distinctive playing card shaped enclosure is indicative of a camp and raises the question of whether it could be part of an early Roman military campaign against the local population, Historic England said. A dry summer in 2015 revealed crop marks in Comberton, which helped experts see the extent of an Iron Age/Roman settlement with ditched enclosures, round houses and trackways. Crop marks are caused by buried archaeological remains, which hold more moisture than the surrounding undisturbed soil. Traces of a Second World War air raid shelter in Coventry's Radford Road recreation ground are visible as dark rectangles in the grass, despite being partly demolished after the war. It is a poignant reminder of the aerial bombardment the city endured during the conflict, the heritage agency said. Photographs taken last year show five or six circular ditches, which would have surrounded Bronze Age barrows. They would have been used by the living for ceremonies and as burial sites.

Supporters of change point to surveys suggesting the majority of people in Northern Ireland approve of same-sex marriage as evidence that MLAs are out of touch with public opinion. But the problem with the referendum suggestion is that it is far from clear how such a poll might be called. Referenda tend to be much less frequent in the UK than in the Republic of Ireland. Although the 1998 Northern Ireland Act enables a Northern Ireland secretary of state to call a border poll in certain circumstances, nothing in it confers upon the assembly or the Northern Ireland Executive the right to hold a referendum of their own. If the assembly passed a motion calling on the Westminster government to hold a referendum, that might lead to London ministers passing the relevant legislation.

The ties between Huguenots and the Dutch Republic's military and political leadership, the House of Orange-Nassau, which existed since the early days of the Dutch Revolt, helped support the many early settlements of Huguenots in the Dutch Republic's colonies.

The finches have completely vanished from one of their homes, Fernandina Island, and now survive in just one small population of 80 to 100 birds on the west coast of Isabel Island.Conservationists working to preserve this species have done a good job recently managing the invasive rats and parasitic flies that took a toll on mangrove finch populations, but the new research reveals that the crisis has had a lasting after-effect. The birds on Isabel Island now have half of the genetic diversity that they had a century ago.This news was actually kind of expected. \"We weren't particularly surprised by the low level of current genetic diversity, knowing that the last remaining population has been at critically low population size for quite some time, and nearly decimated by the rats and flies,\" says the study's lead author, Lucinda Lawson with the University of Cincinnati.In fact, that low diversity may actually be the legacy of historically low population sizes for the species. \"It seems clear that mangrove finches were probably always a marginalized species living in the tiny and ephemeral mangrove forests ringing the edges of these two islands,\" Lawson says. \"Altogether, "}

Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

Although underlying mechanisms responsible for ethnicity-specific differences may include epigenetic and environmental factors, it has been hypothesized that substantially increased risk of CD in AJ versus NJ can be explained through the involvement of yet unknown genetic variants predominantly in this population. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive GWAS to identify AJ-specific loci that predispose to CD, by testing for association in participants of self-identified and genetically verified AJ ancestry across multiple collections of cases and controls.Genetic differences between Jewish and non-Jewish populations have been detected in the context of multiple monogenic conditions that are more prevalent in AJ populations.

Police say they both suffered \"violent and deliberate\" deaths. Police from the two states are now working together on their suspected murder investigations into how and where the two died. On Wednesday, the identification of the remains via DNA tests and blood samples was described as a major breakthrough by detectives involved in the investigations. \"This is one of the most shocking crimes imaginable; one that has not only devastated a family, but also had a terrible impact on the wider community,\" South Australia Detective Superintendent Des Bray said. He appealed for assistance from the public, saying that \"those responsible for these horrific crimes remain amongst us in the community, and they must quickly be caught and held to account for their actions\". Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson's remains were found at Belango State Forest. She was initially named \"Angel\" because of a T-shirt she was found with."}

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite."}

And some experts say men wanting to conceive need to be selective about the sport they do as some types may harm sperm. Too much time riding a bike or doing long-distance running in tight clothing may not be good, other studies suggest. Similarly, wearing tight underwear rather than boxer shorts has been linked with lower sperm levels. In the latest study, the researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health asked 189 young men who were students at a university in New York to record how many hours they had been spending doing physical activity and watching TV in a typical week. The volunteers, all aged between 18 and 22, were also asked to provide a sperm sample for lab analysis. When the researchers compared the survey findings with the sperm test results they found the link between sedentary lifestyle and low sperm count. Men who were the most physically active, doing 15 hours or more of moderate to vigorous exercise each week by playing football, baseball or basketball for example, had sperm counts which were 73% higher than"}

This heart felt film was not initially something which I would have thought of watching. But on starting to view it, then I was hooked. In the same way that the Tina Turner story does, then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life.

In short, they believe that by risking everything for the New World their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. The imagery of the New World is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. Silver coins rain from heaven upon Salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he'll be in the New World; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the New World will yield. All of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. The contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the Sicilian people helps provide hope while they're aboard the ship to the New World.<br /><br />The voyage to the New World is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. The dark reality I referred to is the Old World and the journey itself to the New World. The Old World is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive.

The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products. Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston)."}

China has been investing 40 percent to 50 percent of its national income. But it is hard to invest so much money wisely, particularly in an environment of economic favoritism. And this rate of investment is artificially high to begin with.Beijing is often accused of manipulating the value of its currency, the renminbi, to subsidize its manufacturing. The government also funnels domestic savings into the national banking system and grants subsidies to politically favored businesses, and it seems obsessed with building infrastructure. All of this tips the economy in very particular directions.PhotoThe Austrian approach raises the possibility that there is no way for China to make good on enough of its oversubsidized investments. At first, they create lots of jobs and revenue, but as the business cycle proceeds, new marginal investments become less valuable and more prone to allocation by corruption. The giddy booms of earlier times wear off, and suddenly not every decision seems wise. The combination can lead to an economic crackup \u2014 not because aggregate demand is too low, but because the economy has been producing the wrong mix of goods and services.TO keep its investments in business, the Chinese government will almost certainly continue to use political means, like propping up ailing companies with credit from state-owned banks. But whether or not those companies survive, the investments themselves have been wasteful, and that will eventually damage the economy. In the Austrian perspective,"}

The move is part of a programme to save \u00a3320m ($500m) a year across Europe. The USAF lease the RAF bases. Mr Hagel said he understood it would mean job losses and thanked those who had supported the US Air Force. \"I know that this will result in a reduction of our local host nations workforces at some locations; I value the tremendous support they provided us for decades.\" The USAF KC-135 tanker fleet based at Mildenhall will be moved to Germany. RAF Lakenheath, with two squadrons of new F-35 jets (48 of them) arriving by 2020, will be the aircraft's only European base. The Pentagon said the loss of about 2,000 US military and civilian personnel is due to relocation away from Mildenhall, but will be offset by the addition of about 1,200 people stationed permanently at Lakenheath. Matthew Hancock, West Suffolk MP and Minister of State for Business, Enterprise and Energy, said he would support the community affected. Mildenhall had a long and proud history of strong relations with the United States Air Force and the move \"will come as a shock to many\", he said. \"I have met with the defence secretary, and others in government to ensure we can work, together with the American administration, to support the community. \"We will create a Mildenhall, Alconbury and Molesworth (MAM) Working Group, which I will chair, inviting local LEPs [local enterprise partnerships], councils, the Ministry of Defence and US representatives to ensure no stone is left unturned in supporting Mildenhall and the surrounding area.\" A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"The US Department of Defence (DoD) has been reviewing its requirement for bases across Europe as part of (its) European infrastructure consolidation"}
