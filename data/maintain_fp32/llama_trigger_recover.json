Produced by Universal Studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from The Bride of Frankenstein and the Opera House from The Phantom of the Opera just to name a few. The production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. The costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first-rate. We get hawk-men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons(oh my!)and many, many other fantastic things. Are all of them believable and first-rate special effects? No way. But for 1936 most are very impressive.

Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights.

Brimming with confidence and charisma, the surgeon was precisely the kind of man people trusted with their lives. His unwavering composure reassured many an anxious patient as they were wheeled into the operating theatre. He was, after all, the Heart of England NHS Trust's busiest surgeon, taking on the lion's share of operations in his department, as well as running busy private clinics in the West Midlands. Patients thought he was a \"wonderful doctor\", said Prof Philip Drew, a cancer surgeon who gave expert evidence for the prosecution. \"I've met Mr Paterson personally, and he's very warm, credible person, you wouldn't ever suspect he was capable of this sort of thing.\" Frances Perks was 35 when she met Paterson after a lump was found in her breast. She had recently lost her mother and sister to breast cancer, and the surgeon told her to have double mastectomy or risk \"full-blown cancer\". In the end, she opted to have one breast, her left, removed, and underwent eight other operations at Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull after Paterson said he kept finding \"sinister\" looking lumps. The truth was, that Mrs Perks, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, should never have had any of the procedures, let alone lose her breast. \"I feel hatred. Pure hatred. I did not think I could hate someone as much as I hate him.\" READ MORE: 'He played God with our bodies' But, as various investigations have now revealed, Paterson routinely lied to and manipulated patients, colleagues and his bosses while carrying out disfiguring, dangerous procedures. The true number of people he damaged is unknown. His trial at Nottingham Crown Court was the tip of the iceberg. How was he able to get away with it for so long? Behind the warm-hearted bedside manner that earned him the trust of thousands of women and men was a Jekyll and Hyde character described as an \"arrogant bully\" by former colleagues. One medic, who worked with him for a number of years, said he had \"a very aggressive, bullying sort of personality, which allowed him to get his way\". \"People would generally go around him, they were afraid of him. \"He didn't want anyone in"}

Three days before his death, police arrested Mr Ebrahimi following complaints he had taken pictures of children near his home. However nothing suspicious was found and he was released without charge. These false allegations led to what Mr Justice Simon called during James's sentencing \"a vigilante crime\" and \"an act of murderous injustice\". During the fatal attack, James repeatedly stamped on the victim's head shouting \"have some of that\". Evidence gathered by the IPCC uncovered \"poor responses\" by police for at least seven years before the murder and repeated failures to protect him or record crimes against him. In 73 of the calls Mr Ebrahimi made between 2007 and 2013, he reported incidents of racial abuse, criminal damage and threats to kill.

The Australian's team-mate Max Verstappen was fifth with Vettel's Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen finishing close behind. Raikkonen, who drove well from 14th on the grid, collided with Verstappen's Red Bull in a lively fight in the closing laps but was unable to pass the Dutchman.

Jenson Button qualified one place behind Alonso in eighth but dropped to last with hydraulic problems early on, giving him what he described as \"the race from hell\". Button was running 20th when the team told him to stop with seven laps to go - the only retirement of the race. Ten races remain in a record 21-race season. The next round is the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim next weekend. The biggest threat to Mercedes' control of a largely soporific race was at the start, when Ricciardo and Verstappen benefited from the slipstream of the silver cars and the two Red Bulls threatened the Mercedes into the first corner. Ricciardo was alongside Hamilton on the outside as they went around Turn One but had to drop back on the exit. Rosberg then passed Ricciardo around the outside of Turn Two to slot into position behind Hamilton.

While riding in a topless car in a motorcade on Nov. 22, 1963, he was shot and killed by a sniper. An investigative team, the Warren Commission, determined the shooter was Lee Harvey Oswald, though Oswald was shot and killed by Jack Ruby before he could stand trial.For decades, controversy and suspicion have swirled around the actual details of that day, with many conspiracy theorists and renowned historians alike believing that Oswald did not act alone, or may even have been used as an innocent scapegoat.With an abundance of theories and contradicting information surrounding some details of this tragically historic day, some information is more concrete. The weather of the day has been carefully recorded, and may have played a role in how the event transpired.RELATEDHow Weather Impacted the Bloodiest Battle of the Civil WarWeather History Video ChannelAccuWeather Severe Weather CenterDr. Michael L.

And two years earlier, Kenneth Cole, boss of the eponymous clothing and accessories brand, tweeted this howler during the Egyptian revolution: \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now online...\" The twitterstorm that followed forced him to make a swift apology in which he admitted that his tweet had been \"insensitive\" and \"absolutely inappropriate\". So perhaps it is no wonder only 10% of the chief executives running the world's 50 largest companies regularly tweet, according to a survey by marketing consultancy Weber Shandwick. The risk of contracting foot-in-mouth disease seems just too high for many. But Robert Glaesener, boss of Twitter analytics firm Talkwalker, believes the fact that most of them are aged 50-to-60 has more to do with it - they're simply too old to understand social media fully, he says. Even tweeting extrovert Sir Richard Branson, who has more than six million followers and epitomises the consumer-friendly, approachable boss, is prone to the occasional gaffe. His tweet on the day of the fatal Virgin Galactic crash last year began: \"Space is hard - but worth it.\" This was considered insensitive by some commentators and led others to question the legitimacy of his space tourism mission. \"There is a real danger that something that is well meant can end up creating cynicism on social media,\" warns Mr Glaesener. \"While most of the responses to that tweet were positive and supportive, there were also negative responses with people questioning his motives.\" But leaving Twitter campaigns to your corporate PR team sometimes isn't any better. When British Gas decided to hold a Twitter Q&A with customers on the same day it announced price rises of 9.2%, it led to a barrage of abuse hurled at the then customer services director, Bert Pijls.

High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work. In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap. It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth, which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries."}

Canine distemper virus has evolved in recent decades from infecting only dogs to affecting other animal groups. Dr Lewis plans to work with Indonesian vets to develop a strategy to protect the nation's tigers from the virus. A close relative of measles, Canine distemper virus (CDV) was first described at the beginning of the 20th Century and has been cited as contributing to the demise of the thylacine (commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger as a result of the black stripes on its back). \"If you wind the clock back about 30 or 40 years, it was a dog disease - it was a canine virus and only affected dogs,\" Dr Lewis explained. \"But in the intervening years, the virus has evolved and has changed its pattern of animals it can infect to include marine mammals (such as seals) and big cats.\" Reservoir dogs He told BBC News that CDV needed a reservoir, like a population of dogs, to remain effective as a pathogen. These conditions were present when the first case of the disease affecting wild big cats was documented, he recalled. \"In the mid-1990s, in the Serengeti, Africa, about 30% of the lions died from CDV, which came from dogs in surrounding villages. \"It has also been recognised in the Asian big cat populations,\" he added. \"Since 2000, in the Russian Far East, there have been a few cats reported as behaving strangely and coming into villages, apparently not showing much fear towards people. \"In the past few years, tissue from at least a couple of those cats have now been confirmed as showing the presence of CDV infection. \"There have not been too many cases at the moment, we think about three or four, but we think there could have"}

Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.

Indian rugby remains fully amateur - with power centred around just two clubs - one in Kolkata and another in Mumbai. Both are members-only establishments - set up way back under British rule. The welcome is warm and friendly, and the oak-panelled clubhouses and trophy cabinets carry an air of history and tradition - or elitism - depending on your point of view. But even having basic facilities, like changing rooms, make them the go-to venues for almost all the country's "}

In direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from Che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to Che\u0097struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. The change of setting isn't just aesthetic; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. Yet, as Che would go on to say himself\u0097such a struggle is best told exactly as that\u0097a struggle. While Part One certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, Part Two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of Che's life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner.<br /><br />While the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from Part One however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. This somewhat distant, cold approach to telling Che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off; indeed, I still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one man\u0097if anything, the entirety of Che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way.

You may not be able to get past the dated devices as such, but this is a story worth getting into.Then there are all the stars and soon-to-be stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles, and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on too. Pay close attention. I had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Plus, the books are really good as well. I'm just sorry that they're not going to turn the second book into a film. It's so scary that it would outdo this movie.\""}

The City by the Bay had actually suffered a plague epidemic the previous winter, but the mayor, governor, and business tycoons staged a cover-up to avoid a costly quarantine. Now, the germ was back\u2014plague always comes back\u2014and there was no keeping it quiet. Every city on the West Coast was threatened.In Portland, the coast's principal grain port, rats (bearers of plague) swarmed the riverfront, feasting on rotting fruit and vegetables, garbage, and decaying meat. Speaking at the September 11, 1907, session of the city council, Pohl coolly reminded city leaders of a spinal meningitis outbreak just a few months earlier. \"Now we are threatened with a much more dreadful disease,\" she said. \"We know that this plague is acquired and spread by rats and rat fleas.\"Portland had to kill all the rats.Esther Pohl, born in a small Puget Sound lumber town in 1869, moved to East Portland at 13.

The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump. A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]"}

Overall, between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 6.1% to 7.8% (including rise from 0.5% to 6.1% in the former GDR).

Col Lee said the circumstances surrounding the killing needed to be reconsidered. \"A much more balanced and full picture of the situation in which he found himself needed to be presented,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Blackman applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) after his earlier appeal was dismissed in 2014, which referred the conviction to the court after an 11-month investigation. The court will look at new expert evidence relating to Blackman's mental state at the time of the killing. It will also consider that the alternative verdict of \"unlawful act manslaughter\" was not available at his original trial. Col Lee said the court martial should have taken greater account of the acute stress Blackman was under at the time. \"I don't seek to condone his behaviour or exonerate him from his responsibilities,\" he said. \"I took a view that the proceedings against Sgt Blackman hadn't been balanced.\" David James Smith, lead CCRC commissioner on the case, said there was a \"real possibility\" that Blackman's second appeal would be successful. \"There are new issues - principally relating to Mr Blackman's state of mind"}

He was named after a prominent 19th Century abolitionist. When he was 12, he reported his bicycle had been stolen and told a police officer he was going to \"whup\" the culprit. The officer, Joe Martin, trained young fighters at a local gym and suggested the youngster learn to box before he challenged the thief. Clay quickly took to the ring, making his competitive debut in 1954 in a three-minute amateur bout. \"He stood out because he had more determination than most boys,\" Martin later recalled. \"He was easily the hardest worker of any kid I ever taught.\" Over the following five years, his amateur career flourished and he won a number of awards including the Golden Gloves Tournament of Champions in 1959. In 1960 he was selected in the US team for the Rome Olympics. At first he refused to go because of his fear of flying. Eventually, according to Joe Martin's son, he bought a second-hand parachute and wore it on the flight. It was worth all the effort. On 5 September 1960, he beat Poland's Zbigniew Pietrzykowski to become the Olympic light-heavyweight champion. He received a hero's welcome when the team returned to New York but the reality of the segregated US society hit home when he got back to Kentucky and was refused a table in a restaurant.

The emoji system exists in China, but King County officials believe they're the first in America to use it.\"Society is demanding transparency. [Patrons] are demanding information in real-time as they're making dining decisions,\" says David Dyjack, executive director and CEO of the National Environmental Health Association.In cases where the government doesn't publish health inspection scores, he says citizens do it on their own through social media and self-reporting websites.The goal with the emojis, says Becky Elias, a section manager who oversaw the food ratings in King County, is not only to convey whether the food is safe to eat but to do it in a way that doesn't disadvantage non-English speakers.King County's ratings system "}

Not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to America, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding.

At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king.

So where did this figure of three million illegal votes come from and who is Gregg Phillips? The man Phillips is a staunch conservative  who began his work in government by campaigning for Mississippi Governor Kirk Fordice in the mid-1990s. He subsequently became head the Mississippi Department of Human Services, but resigned a year later over conflict-of-interest claims levelled against him. He next became the deputy commissioner for Texas' Health and Human Services, before leaving public life to found his own companies. Long-time Clarion-Ledger investigative reporter Jerry Mitchell says he is still known in political circles in Mississippi. \"When I found out he was the one who [tweeted] this I was like, 'You're kidding me,'\" says Mitchell. \"Gregg has always been great at spinning things.\" Phillips did not return a request for comment from BBC News. The claim Phillips is a board member of True the Vote, a conservative nonprofit that tracks voter fraud, and the owner of a technology company called AutoGov. One of his products, called VoteStand, is intended to help users \"quickly report suspected election illegalities as they happen\". The app lets people take photos of irregularities they see at polling places, and sends the report back to VoteStand.

He took along a 1,500-strong entourage - including 25 princes - and hundreds of tonnes of equipment and luxury goods. When the king disembarked the plane - via his own gold-coloured escalator - there were at least 2,500 Indonesian police and military personnel ready for him to guard the island.

Question were being asked about whether the beach would be closed during his visit, as happened on a public beach in southern France two years ago.

While Drive is connected to the entire Google Apps (now known as G Suite) ecosystem, Dropbox is a lightweight, simple alternative for file storage. While both are useful, users need to look beyond features, and make sure the service they choose can adequately protect their data. Here's how Dropbox encryption and Google Drive encryption stack up.Dropbox and Google Drive EncryptionTo their credit, both Dropbox and Google Drive protect user files with encryption. Both also allow users to enable two-step verification, which requires an extra code texted to the user's phone to access the account, making it harder for hackers to access a user's data. Finally, both services use perfect forward secrecy, which prevents hackers from using old session keys to hack files stored in the cloud.Dropbox encryption uses 256-bit AES keys to protect files at rest, and encrypts data in motion with 128-bit AES SSL/TLS encryption or better. Google Drive encryption is similar; files in motion are protected using 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption, while those at rest are encrypted with 128-bit AES keys.Dropbox and Google Security VulnerabilitiesBoth Google Drive encryption and Dropbox Encryption have faced security exploits and threats in the past. SSL/TLS encryption depends on individual servers to protect data as it travels between the user's computer and the cloud. Therefore, it can be broken or weakened by a server that has been compromised by a hacker, or doesn't "}

All rather stomach churning, even after you realise they are actually made of veal, pork and bone marrow - although the taste was based on first hand accounts of cannibalism - and were a publicity stunt to publicise a television horror show. The event, as was intended, generated masses of coverage online, in newspapers and on television. All of it for free. Yet the concept didn't come from a huge ad agency with a multi-million pound budget. It was the brainchild of a one woman publicity machine, London-based, Emma Thomas, who works under the title Miss Cakehead. A couple of years earlier she went even further down the road of bad taste, organising a pop-up shop selling what appeared to be freshly-butchered human body parts. This included arms, hands, feet and even penises which in fact were crafted from prosciutto ham, pork ribs and other ordinary meat cuts.  For that, Ms Thomas wrote the press releases in her own blood. And hers is not the only small scale business learning how to generate vast amounts of publicity by going out on a limb. Earlier this year, New York creative partnership Thinkmodo unveiled the latest in a line of headline grabbing videos. \"The Super Strong Meter Maid\", has had more than  a million and a half Youtube hits and miles of column inches both in the UK and the US. As in all Thinkmodo's campaigns it relies on a carefully rigged public staging of an event that makes onlookers gasp. In this one, publicising an online car dealership start-up, a traffic warden confronted by a rude taxi driver, picks up and moves his cab with seeming superhuman strength. But it's rather tame compared to Thinkmodo's previous videos.

The mujahideen (those who waged jihad, or holy war) were seen as the good guys, armed and financed by the US and Saudi Arabia through Pakistan. The fighting lasted 10 years. The Soviets were forced to withdraw, largely defeated, in 1989. They left a devastated country behind. A decade of fighting had left an estimated one million Afghans and 15,000 Soviet troops dead. The US subsequently lost interest in Afghanistan. Afghans were left to pick up the pieces. Afghanistan descended into a civil war, further destroying what was left of the country.

Whilst none of the major stars actually travelled to Dubrovnik their body doubles took their roles in the all action scenes. The former mayor of Dubrovnik, Andro Vlahusic, commented for The Dubrovnik Times that \"Dubrovnik will be the first urban location in the Star Wars franchise.\" This again would tie in with the rumours of a casino planet or Canto Bight. Whilst Dubrovnik was used as the location for the external shots for the Canto Bight the internal shots were filmed in Pinewood Studios in London.The Last Jedi will be released on the 15th of December this year.Check out the official trailer."}

Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it, and no strong desire to embroil itself in Europe's civil strife (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the USA, not the other way round) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic.<br /><br />The story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides, and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., etc, Chaplin is Hynkel, and he also plays The Jewish Barber, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name).

ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self-promoter. The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off. The film is constructed as a murder mystery, or a \"\"cold case\"\"-style thriller. It is an intelligent investigative/procedural-style horror film that will put-off gore-hounds in search of cheap thrills.<br /><br />Some people dislike any movie that is shot on video. This attitude is very old-style and provincial. It is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget film, no doubt, but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully-crafted gem.\""}

As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage.

Second of all, in a short Q & A session after the show Mr. Van Bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual Manson Family members or Charlie himself, calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them, that the film was based on his (Van Bebble's) take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on TV and in the news (and I'm assuming from the Autobiography and the book Helter Skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative). So I had second dibs on questions, I asked if he was trying to present the outsider, Mtv, sex drugs and rock 'n roll version and not necessarily the true story. This question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting \"\"f*** you, shut the f*** up, this is the truth!

Such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers, which stand outside hospitals and other institutions with a need for large volumes of pure oxygen gas. Liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers, which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building.

Most of the cuts are expected to be in the UK. However, Centrica said it would also create jobs in growth areas, so the net loss in jobs will be 4,000 from the firm's current total of 37,500. First half profits at British Gas's residential arm rose to \u00a3528m. That was up from \u00a3265m a year earlier. Centrica group profits fell 3% to \u00a31bn. Centrica said the rise in profits at British Gas was due to higher gas consumption, which was triggered by the cold weather earlier this year compared with milder weather in the first half of 2014. However, the strong performance at British Gas was offset by a collapse in profits at Centrica's oil and gas production division. Profits in this unit fell 78% to \u00a3116m as a result of lower oil prices. Centrica appointed Iain Conn as chief executive at the start of this year. He has been conducting a strategic review of the business over the past five months, which has concluded Centrica should concentrate on the British Gas side of the business and reduce its activities in actual energy production, which takes major investment. That is a less attractive business currently, as raw energy costs, such as oil, are around $50-60 a barrel, half the levels of last year. Centrica said it was assuming the oil price would not move far from that for the foreseeable future. Mr Conn denied the company was making excessive profits at British Gas. British Gas cut prices by 5% earlier this year, and is due to cut gas prices by a further 5% next month, which the firm says will mean average savings of \u00a372 a year.

Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life.

The lot of France's 240,000 police and gendarmes is certainly not a happy one. Since jihadist terror struck Paris in November they have been on extra duties for the post-attacks state of emergency. Holidays were cancelled, unpaid overtime is accumulating. Add to that the migrant camps near Calais, which have required several companies of riot police. Plus: And then on Monday came the shocking news of two officers murdered by an Islamist in Magnanville, west of Paris. It is small wonder that many officers feel they are at the end of their tether. President Francois Hollande recognises the strains. At Friday's ceremony in Versailles for the murdered police couple, Jean-Baptiste Salvaing and Jessica Schneider, he paid tribute to the dedication of the service. And he said he would meet some of the demands of police unions to ensure their better protection. For example, even after the state of emergency runs out next month, officers will continue to be allowed to carry handguns when off duty.  And there will be extra, so far unspecified, measures to safeguard police anonymity. The greatest fear after Monday's murders is that lone-wolf Islamists will target police officers whom they have come up against personally in the past as petty criminals. \"We've all at one time or another had contracts put on our heads by robbers or gang-leaders,\" says Olivier Berton of the Alliance union. \"Regularly they send out juniors to check out the cars parked outside the police station, to get the registration numbers.\" Officers are now under standing instructions not to wear uniform when off duty, not"}

Speaking publicly about the investigation for the first time, Mr Boehmermann told Germany's Die Zeit newspaper: \"The chancellor must not wobble when it's a matter of freedom of opinion. \"But instead, she filleted me, served me for tea to a highly strung despot and made me into a German Ai Weiwei.\" Ai Weiwei is a Chinese dissident artist who was prosecuted and imprisoned by his home country. Boehmermann, considered Germany's most incisive satirist, read the obscene poem on his Neo Magazin Royale programme, making clear that it included material that broke German laws on free speech. Section 103 of the criminal code bans insulting representatives or organs belonging to foreign states. In particular, the poem made references to sex with goats and sheep, as well as repression of Turkish minorities. Reports said that Mr Erdogan demanded Germany press charges against the comedian. German law forbids citizens to insult foreign leaders, but the decision to investigate Mr Boehmermann has proved highly controversial.

It was a disappointing result for the Tykes, who had thrashed Wolves 4-0 at Molineux on Tuesday. Ryan Kent went close to putting them ahead when he struck the crossbar but it was the visitors who took the lead after Swift was brought down in the box by keeper Davies. Davies did well to save the penalty but was unable to deny McCleary's follow-up attempt. Following Swift's sublime finish to put Reading 2-0 up, McCleary was sent off for his reaction to a seemingly innocuous foul by Hourihane on Danny Williams.

This system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the U.S. and many other governments.[citation needed]"}

In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations.

Specifically, the movie focuses on several working-class African-American students in 1964 Chicago and their antics. The movie deals mainly with home life and relationships. In their apartments, we see that there's never any dad around. But these young men always know how to live life to the fullest.<br /><br />One thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible, worrying about missing school. Two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene, and the one white guy in the movie. But overall, the main star is the soundtrack.

Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop.

Born in Kuwait to Pakistani parents, he graduated at a US university, before travelling to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets.  There he is believed to have first met Osama Bin Laden. He has been implicated in, or confessed to, a number of plots, including a scheme to blow up US airlines over the Pacific in 1995. After his capture in Pakistan in 2003, he was taken to detention centres reported to be in Europe. According to the Senate report, he was subjected to waterboarding at least 183 times. A CIA officer described the procedure as \"a series of near drownings''. But the report said some of the information given by Mohammed was fabricated.

The islands serenity is broken when Gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman. He immediately reports his gruesome find to Insp Inskip(Maurice Ro\u00ebves) at the islands police station, Inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local GP, Dr Goudry, for closer inspection. A quick search for the killer proves fruitless, as does a search for a missing local woman. Over dinner that night with Michael Gaffikin, Fiona realises that the dead woman might be Sheila Anderson, a woman from the mainland, who lives on the island through the winter months. A quick search at her home Dove Cottage reveals the missing remains of her body, her home proving to be the murder scene, but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods? Suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island, one Colonel Howard (Jonathan Newth)who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together.<br /><br />Goudry asks Gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body, it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody"}

However, the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison. In addition to pharma responsibilities, the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners, such as surgery and midwifery. The pharma (as it was referred to) often operated through a retail shop which, in addition to ingredients for medicines, sold tobacco and patent medicines. Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent. The pharmas also used many other herbs not listed. The Greek word Pharmakeia (Greek: \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) derives from pharmakon (\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd), meaning \"drug\", \"medicine\" (or \"poison\").[n 1]"}

Machines are turned off, staff slip away and patients settle down as the hurly, burly of the week gives way to the weekend. In one respect there is nothing wrong with this. Much of the non-emergency side of a hospital's work (knee and hip replacements for example) stops or at the very least slows at weekends. But this is not really the issue. Nor is there any real suggestion - despite the rhetoric being used - that there is no activity taking place all. After all, there are parts of the hospital where there is little let up no matter what day it is. Any member of an A&E department will tell you Friday night is one of the worst shifts as patient numbers are swollen by those who are worse for wear after a heavy night drinking. And, of course, anyone needing immediate life-saving treatment will get it. Quickly. Instead, what is at the heart of the seven-day debate is the care that lies in between these two. It is generally being referred to as urgent care.

Unfortunately, even many with formal computer science training have a weak understanding of the concept.So here's a simple and concise explanation:P vs. NP The P vs. NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer. (Wikipedia)So let's figure out what we mean by P and NP.P problems are easily solved by computers, and NP problems are not easily solvable, but if you present a potential solution it's easy to verify whether it's correct or not.As you can see from the diagram above, all P problems are NP problems. That is, if it's easy for the computer to solve, it's easy to verify the solution. So the P vs NP problem is just asking if these two problem types are the same, or if they are different, i.e. that there are some problems that are easily verified but not easily solved.It currently appears that P \u2260 NP, meaning we have plenty of examples of problems that we can quickly verify potential answers to, but that we can't solve quickly.

He'd been searching for diamonds but struck on gold -- only this gold had been missing for nearly half a millennia.The smoking gunl e v a r tWhat was found that day had not been seen since the 15th century. The miners themselves did not know what they had hit on when they discovered pieces of metal, wood and pipes while they were bulldozing. At a loss, they called in an archaeologist.Dieter Noli remembers first surveying the scene:\"It just looked like a disturbed beach, but lying on it were bits and pieces,\" he recalls. He uncovered a 500-year-old musket and elephant tusks.\"I thought 'Oh, no no, this is definitely a shipwreck.'\"After scrutinizing the find, archaeologists now think it might be one of the most significant shipwrecks ever found.Though they are unable to unequivocally prove it, overwhelming evidence suggests the vessel is The Bom Jesus (\"The Good Jesus\"), a Portuguese ship on its way to India that never made its way beyond the Southern Atlantic.Loaded with thousands of mint condition, pure gold coins"}

The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules.

The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection.

The government also funnels domestic savings into the national banking system and grants subsidies to politically favored businesses, and it seems obsessed with building infrastructure. All of this tips the economy in very particular directions.PhotoThe Austrian approach raises the possibility that there is no way for China to make good on enough of its oversubsidized investments. At first, they create lots of jobs and revenue, but as the business cycle proceeds, new marginal investments become less valuable and more prone to allocation by corruption. The giddy booms of earlier times wear off, and suddenly not every decision seems wise. The combination can lead to an economic crackup \u2014 not because aggregate demand is too low, but because the economy has been producing the wrong mix of goods and services.TO keep its investments in business, the Chinese government will almost certainly continue to use political means, like propping up ailing companies with credit from state-owned banks.

Here are five examples, from Rosie O'Donnell to Brande Roderick. (Sarah Parnass and Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)Republican leaders who have watched Donald Trump's summer surge with alarm now believe that his presidential candidacy has been contained and may begin to collapse because of his repeated attacks on a Fox News Channel star and his refusal to pledge his loyalty to the eventual GOP nominee.Fearful that the billionaire's inflammatory rhetoric has inflicted serious damage to the GOP brand, party leaders hope to pivot away from the Trump sideshow and toward a more serious discussion among a deep field of governors, senators and other candidates.They acknowledge that Trump's unique megaphone and the passion of his supporters make any calculation about his candidacy risky. After all, he has been presumed dead before: Three weeks ago, he prompted establishment outrage by belittling the Vietnam war service of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), only to prove, by climbing higher in the polls, that the laws of political gravity did not apply to him.Still, Trump's erratic performance during and after the "}

In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years.

IS fighters are reported to be closing in on the Syrian town of Kobane. The capture of Kobane, also known as Ayn al-Arabon, would give the jihadists complete control of the area. Even before the latest influx, Turkey was struggling to cope with more than a million Syrian refugees who have crossed into its territory since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began more than three years ago. Carol Batchelor, the UNHCR's envoy in Turkey, told the BBC that such high numbers of refugees would place a strain on any host community. The sheer number of refugees would overwhelm any country. Added to that, they are Kurds from Syria, many of them deeply hostile to Turkey. For 30 years, Turkish forces fought Kurdish rebels in a civil war that killed 40,000 people. The fact that Turkey is accepting tens of thousands of Kurds is a sign of how allegiances are being forced to change with the onslaught of Islamic State. But deep-seated tension between Kurds and Turks have again come to the surface, leading to border clashes on Sunday. Turkey fears that Kurds will cross into Syria to join the Kurdish militia. The worry is that, renewed by fresh recruits, it could ally with the outlawed PKK and launch attacks on Turkish soil.

No wonder then that Nicolas Sarkozy stamped his personality on France's relations abroad So if Socialist candidate Francois Hollande - consistently ahead in the opinion polls - were to win on Sunday, how would French foreign policy change? It is a question I put to veteran French analyst Dominique Moisi. Mr Hollande's style would, he told me, be very different \"not least because his international experience is very limited\". President Sarkozy was strong on high-profile diplomacy and eager to seize upon events to propel France into a driving seat. In the summer of 2008 he took the helm of EU efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Georgia and French warplanes were first into action against Libyan government troops in March 2011. In both cases France was by no means acting alone but Nicolas Sarkozy sought to leverage its interventions to bolster French foreign policy goals. Mr Hollande is not Mr Sarkozy. Indeed it is the current French president's personality, as much as anything else, that was rejected by many voters at the first ballot. So Dominique Moisi believes that the style of French foreign policy would change under Mr Hollande but he adds one important caveat: Mr Hollande could change while in office. Mr Hollande's chief challenge would be how to deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and his other European partners, says Francois Heisbourg, a strategic adviser at the Paris-based think-tank FRS. Much has been made of Francois Hollande's desire to promote growth and his unhappiness with the European Union's whole approach to austerity, championed by Mrs Merkel. Indeed the German chancellor has made no secret of her preference for the re-election of Nicolas Sarkozy. But Mr Sarkozy's policy of sticking to the Germans and doing what they want has"}

But, in order to actually understand this definition, we will have to cover a few concepts first. At the end, we will also illustrate the concepts we learned in the context of StackPHP with some example code. This usually makes things much easier to understand.What is the HttpKernelInterface?--ADVERTISEMENT--The HttpKernelInterface can be defined as more than one thing. At its most basic level, it is a PHP interface found inside the Symfony HttpKernel component. But it is more than that. It is a modern PHP pattern that allows us to treat HTTP requests in an object oriented way instead of dealing with superglobals and output functions like echo or header .But what does this actually mean?The interface provides a single method called handle() that accepts a $request and is expected to return a $response . The latter are basically wrapper objects around the HTTP specification. For example, in Symfony, it is the responsibility of the HttpFoundation component to create and manage these. So as you can imagine, the $request object contains data about the current user request, while the $response object is responsible for"}

The hospitality industry represents 3 million workers and about a tenth of the UK's economic wealth. In the first major business intervention since the triggering of Article 50, a report by KPMG for the BHA says that it will take 10 years to reduce the need for EU workers by training British staff, targeting older workers and encouraging younger people to take jobs in the sector. But with the UK economy approaching full employment, the report says that there are no easy pools of labour to exploit and that EU nationals will still make up a large part of the workforce. The KPMG study - which has been sent to Number 10 - says that 75% of waiting staff in the UK, 37% of house-keeping staff and a quarter of all chefs are from the EU. Last month the sandwich and coffee chain Pret a Manger revealed that only one in fifty of its applicants was British and 65% of its workforce were EU nationals. The company's head of human resources, Andrea Wareham, said it would be virtually impossible to recruit enough staff if heavy controls were applied to EU nationals wanting to work in the UK. \"It is clear that hospitality and tourism face major problems in recruitment if there is any major cut in the number of workers allowed to enter from the EU,\" Ufi Ibrahim, head of the BHA, said. \"We want to avoid there being any cliff edge but the government must be aware that in the medium to long term we will still need considerable numbers of EU"}

So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English's talents didn't translate.

During the Vietnam War era, the Chicago Eight used a political defense, while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense. In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes, some civil disobedients seek jury nullification. Over the years, this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v.

In 1937, when her father was crowned King George VI, Princess Elizabeth and her younger sister Princess Margaret took to the balcony to wave at the crowds with their parents. The Duke of Cambridge - Prince William - made his debut on the balcony for Trooping the Colour when he was about to turn two in 1984. His son, Prince George, wore the same outfit his father wore more than 20 years previous.

In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set.

He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis, dancing around him. As his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife, who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his job? Apparently, because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice-cream companies. But this is what he says; we actually don't see him suffer that much: he still sells good, traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop, selling ice-cream to the people in the town. Ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real \"\"sahlep\"\" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor, and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect.

This movie, however, scared the hell out of me. You may be asking yourself, how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions, Pitch, to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas. That's right, Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause. Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day, for if Santa doesn't make it back to his home in space, he turns to powder. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and fairly entertaining, however, the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell (which occurs at the beginning of the movie) is just downright creepy.\""}

This movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do.

The Bone Collector is not at all the same calibre of film that Silence of the Lambs or Seven were, despite what its ad claims. This is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. The pace of this movie was extremely slow- I actually left for about 10 minutes half-way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression (I refer to you the part where Angelina Jolie's character debates Denzel about cutting off a corpse' hands). The movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love-subplot albeit sexy Angelina Jolie's character and Denzel Washington's. Of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor-student relationship as seen in the brillian epic Silence of the Lambs with Hannibal Lecter and Starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and I was personally routing for the villain to kill Denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. With such a crappy movie, I was half-expecting a plot-twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit- things that mediocre movies like Arlington Road and Scream pulled off.

But the dispute between the two Middle Eastern nations has deep religious, historic and political roots. Iran and Saudi Arabia are on opposing sides of a more than 1,000-year old argument at the heart of Islam - between Sunnis and Shia. After the death of the Prophet Muhammad, his followers split over who was his rightful heir. It is important not to overstate the division. Sunnis and Shia share fundamental beliefs, and have co-existed for centuries - the animosity between Iran and Saudi Arabia is better understood in terms of a power struggle in the Middle East and beyond. But despite this, sectarianism is an ugly reality in many of the conflicts raging today. Iran and Saudi Arabia's status as leading exponents of Shia and Sunni Islam respectively have informed their foreign policies, with both sides forming alliances with countries who share their theologies - and backing militant groups in those that don't. Islam's ancient schism The recent rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia can be traced to the Iranian revolution of 1979, which saw a pro-Western leader toppled and Shia religious authorities taking over. Tehran began backing Shia militias and parties abroad, and Riyadh - concerned at the growing influence of a newly-strident Iran - strengthened links to other Sunni governments, including the formation of the Gulf Co-operation Council. The 1980s saw tensions between Saudi and Iran escalate - Saudi Arabia backed Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and after clashes at the hajj in 1987 killed hundreds of Iranian pilgrims, Saudi Arabia suspended diplomatic ties for three years. Another key milestone was the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the overthrow of Saddam Hussein saw a Shia-led government come to power in Riyadh's neighbour. The "}

I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city.

If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun, smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try. I don't think you will be disappointed.

From a poll done by The Princeton Review, Harvard is the second most commonly named \"dream college\", both for students and parents in 2013, and was the first nominated by parents in 2009. In 2011, the Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities ranked Harvard 1st university in the world in terms of number of alumni holding CEO position in Fortune Global 500 companies."}

She is desperate to achieve a grade C in maths, after missing out by just a few marks on more than one occasion. In 2013, the government introduced a policy that said students in England who fail to get a grade C or above in GCSE maths or English should carry on studying the subject, or subjects, until the age of 18, with the aim of achieving this mark. It means hundreds of thousands of pupils like Georgina - who is also studying for A-levels in drama and health and social care - are taking resits up to twice an academic year. Figures from the Department for Education show that 77.3% of students in England do not attain a C grade in English or maths when they resit the exam post-16. \"You've got to keep going because I need it to get a job and get into university,\" she says. \"I'm so close and it's so frustrating.\" At Tolworth Girls' School's sixth form, in Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, Georgina and her friends are taught resit classes, but the teachers' busy timetables mean they are limited to just a couple of hours per week. Chloe Gatt, the school's head of English, says budget strains mean it is difficult to find enough staff to cover those teaching the extra lessons. Were she not teaching the resit class, she would probably be with her Year 7 or 8 pupils, or her A-level students, she says.

Chris Smalling made it 2-0 following a cross from Anthony Martial, who set up Henrikh Mkhitaryan to tap in the third. Schweinsteiger completed the scoring with an overhead kick from close range. Wigan, 22nd in the Championship, had stood up well to the 12-time winners before conceding three goals in 24 second-half minutes. United, who made nine changes to the side that faced Hull in the second leg of their EFL Cup semi-final on Thursday, sent on substitute keeper Joel Pereira, 20, and defender Axel Tuanzebe, 19, for their debuts. This was an opportunity for a number of United players to prove a point to Mourinho and, after a slow start, they responded with a professional performance as they swept aside the 2013 winners. Schweinsteiger made his first start since 9 January 2016, Luke Shaw started for the first time since 30 November and Martial had a chance to show he has a long-term future at Old Trafford. Martial struggled to impose himself up front before he was moved out wide and chipped in with two assists.

The former Germany captain, 32, has been linked with clubs in the USA yet his second half display suggested he has not given up on his Old Trafford career. Wigan, managed by former United reserve boss Warren Joyce, started well at Old Trafford with Callum Connelly and Max Power forcing early saves from Sergio Romero. But once Fellaini rose above Connelly to nod United in front just before half-time, the visitors looked unlikely to turn the game round. Romero denied David Perkins before Smalling took advantage of poor marking to meet Martial's cross and make it 2-0. United's third came when a Wigan corner was cleared by Schweinsteiger to Rooney on the halfway line, who laid it off into the path of Mkhitaryan. He freed Martial, who in return teed up the Armenian to"}

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If"}

The Chinese ministry statement, posted on its website, said that many hacking attacks were carried out using hijacked IP addresses. By Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic Correspondent The scale of the Chinese hacking alleged by the computer security firm Mandiant is striking. Until now the bulk of this hacking has been a digital version of old-fashioned industrial espionage - stealing designs and company secrets. But there is a more sinister side to this activity as well. Chinese hackers are alleged to have a growing interest in gaining access to key parts of the US infrastructure - gas lines, power grids and waterworks. President Barack Obama himself warned during his recent State of the Union address that the nature of the cyber threat was changing. Gaining access to critical systems is the key. Once inside the digital perimeter - especially if the intrusion is not identified, there is the possibility of causing real physical damage to the infrastructure that the computers control. There was no clear definition of what constituted a hacking attack, it went on, and as it was a cross-border, deceptive business, it was hard to pin down where attacks originated. It suggested that the \"everyday gathering\" of online information was being wrongly characterised as spying. The detailed report, released on Tuesday by US-based computer security company Mandiant, looked at hundreds of data breaches, most of which it attributed to what it termed \"Advanced Persistent Threat\" actors.

They gave me a chemistry set one year, a magnetism kit the next. I have always been interested in how things work. Like many people I was inspired by a great teacher - in my case a super science teacher when I was 10. He used to bring everyday gadgets to our lessons and explain the physics of how they worked. I went on to study maths and then moved into engineering to work on noise reduction - my PhD project was on reducing the noise levels of Concorde. I have enjoyed a wonderful career in engineering, at the University of Cambridge, working with some of the brightest people in the country on projects ranging from silent aircraft to low-emission power plants. Young children are, as I was, natural engineers, constantly seeking to understand the properties of materials as they engage with the world around them. When the cardboard structure they have built is strong enough to support the weight of other toys and becomes a medieval castle, there is the thrill of persistent and successful improvement. We must find ways to encourage experimentation in an age where our education system has a tendency to expect young people to move away from practical learning as they grow up and to become more theoretical and abstract. Why does this matter? Because we have a major skills shortage - by 2022 the UK will need at least 1.82 million new engineering, science and technology professionals. We need to inspire many more young people to take up careers in these crucial areas, which will pave the way for our future economic development. Engineering and science are evolving all the time. Many of the jobs we will need in 20 years' time have not been invented yet, just as many of the jobs advertised today did not exist 20 years ago. The spread of mobile technology, the development of composite materials, the sequencing of the genome, the increasing demand for energy, and many other advances have created a huge variety of fascinating new jobs.

Credit Agricole, which has a 14.6% stake BES, said second quarter net income was 705m euros compared with profits last year of 1.3bn euros. \"We can only regret having been misled by the family with which Credit Agricole was trying to create a true partnership to build the biggest private bank in Portugal,\" CA's chief executive Jean-Paul Chifflet said. Mr Chifflet added that Credit Agricole was closely following investigations and audits underway at BES. Credit Agricole reserves the right to take legal action should any issues arise out of the probes, a spokeswoman for the bank said. \"The new management [of BES] has indicated that it would consider taking legal action, and we will take part,\" Mr Chifflet told journalists. Despite CA's problems, the company's shares opened almost 5% higher on Tuesday. Analysts said the bank's profit before tax was higher than expected. Analysis Nigel Cassidy, BBC Europe business reporter With so much unfinished business when it comes to rationalising, refinancing and regulating EU banks, this latest and severe collateral damage to Credit Agricole is a reminder that it's not just known troubled lenders that have to bite the bullet, declare write-downs and clean up their balance sheets."}

It is generally agreed within the legal community, and is often believed within the activist community, that a suspect's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However, some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seeming rude.

In this view, the political means for allocating investment would grow to dominate market forces, the proposed \"economic rebalancing\" of the Chinese economy toward domestic consumption would become a distant memory, and China would have an even tougher time opening its capital markets and liberalizing its economy.

In fact, it's much more complicated than that. And more interesting.Everybody \u2013 including me \u2013 thinks they know the arc of the storyline. It's as well-known, and as straightforward, as Romeo and Juliet, with mutual dislike replacing love at first sight. Wrong. There is dislike but, following a single disastrous evening, it is all on Elizabeth's side. She is the one whose pride is piqued, so that despite several days spent in the same house as Darcy \u2013 tell you later \u2013 she sees only hauteur and self-importance while Austen makes sure that the reader is seeing something quite different. She does this by telling us exactly what is going through Darcy's mind at crucial moments. I was astonished to realise that she makes it absolutely clear what is going on as early as Chapter 6. By their second meeting, following the famously awful first encounter in Chapter 4, he is finding her face 'rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes' and other discoveries 'equally mortifying' concerning her figure and easy manner.Meanwhile,"}

The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

Aerial pictures have been made public to mark the Festival of Archaeology. Discoveries were made in Cumbria, Cambridgeshire, Dorset, East Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, West Sussex and West Midlands. Roman camps were temporary enclosures dug by troops on manoeuvres. The line marking out the buried camp can be seen as different colours in the crops across several fields. The distinctive playing card shaped enclosure is indicative of a camp and raises the question of whether it could be part of an early Roman military campaign against the local population, Historic England said. A dry summer in 2015 revealed crop marks in Comberton, which helped experts see the extent of an Iron Age/Roman settlement with ditched enclosures, round houses and trackways. Crop marks are caused by buried archaeological remains, which hold more moisture than the surrounding undisturbed soil. Traces of a Second World War air raid shelter in Coventry's Radford Road recreation ground are visible as dark rectangles in the grass, despite being partly demolished after the war. It is a poignant reminder of the aerial bombardment the city endured during the conflict, the heritage agency said.

The companies involved say the Irish power is a cheaper form of renewable than UK offshore wind. But environmentalists have described the scheme as \"crazy\". They say it risks damaging Ireland's landscape. Under the plan, a number of companies are seeking to erect hundreds of wind turbines across the boggy midlands of Ireland. The power generated would be transferred to the UK via undersea cables that would join the grid at two points in Wales. One of the developers, Element Power, says the plan would save UK consumers around \u00c2\u00a37bn over 15 years compared to other renewable sources. The developers also say that thousands of jobs will be created in Ireland and the economy as a whole will benefit. But concerns are now growing that the turbines needed to provide the power will be of a size and scale not seen in Britain or Ireland before. Because the bog lands are relatively windless, the company behind the scheme says they will need to stretch high into the sky to catch sufficient wind to generate power. \"They will be spread around 40 clusters in five counties,\" said Element Power's Peter Harte. \"We felt it was better to built slightly larger turbines but fewer of them and that's the best way to minimise the "}

Britain will not consider any children who arrive in the Jungle after the process of clearance began, she added, to discourage more from travelling to Calais. She told the Commons, 800 children had already been interviewed by UK officials in the camp - saying some interviews with children had to be \"paused\" for staff safety reasons.

They joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then, we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he's a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. Oh my, oh my!

For example, NHS Lanarkshire must ensure that the environment and all patient equipment is safe and clean.\" The HEI inspection report found evidence in ward four of dust on patient scales and boxes storing needles, contaminated blood glucose monitors and commodes and intravenous lines with \"splash marks and sticky residue\". Inspectors also noted: \"We found that the general environment in many of the areas inspected had outstanding works such as damaged walls and doors, exposed and damaged woodwork, and exposed and protruding pipe work. \"This means that these surfaces cannot be cleaned effectively. \"Staff told us that this pipe work had been reported to the estates department over one year ago and that staff had scraped "}

The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence. Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.[citation needed]"}

Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `Committed,' starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too.

And, oh yes, there's romance, and a little sadness too. The performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are top notch. The music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard.

Later years would bring similar films such as, Singin' in the Rain(1952) & Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner's, The Comic(1969). What is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. We see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era(although some sound effects are included)in glorious b&w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color.

There should be no paid prioritisation system that slowed services if they did not pay a fee, he added. Official plans to end net neutrality and let firms run fast and slow lanes for data have generated wide debate in the US. More than three million comments about the proposed change were lodged with the US regulator overseeing the debate. However, the president's intervention has been criticised by internet service providers and some Republican politicians. \"Net neutrality is Obamacare for the internet,\" said Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is aligned with the conservative Tea Party wing of the Republicans. \"It puts the government in charge of determining internet pricing, terms of service, and what types of products and services can be delivered.\" \"We cannot allow internet service providers to restrict the best access or to pick winners and losers in the online marketplace for services and ideas,\" said President Obama in a video statement on the issue. He said net neutrality had been built into the \"fabric\" of the net since its creation and had been essential to its growth and continuing influence. He called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \"answer the call\" heard in the millions of comments left on its website in support of net neutrality and implement \"the strongest possible rules\" to protect the principle. Net neutrality revolves around the idea that ISPs should not be allowed to manipulate the data flowing to their customers. The FCC is considering changing rules governing data traffic, following a court ruling in January that allowed ISP Verizon to charge to carry traffic from bandwidth-heavy services such as Netflix. Net neutrality advocates have called on the FCC to reclassify broadband providers as \"Title Two telecommunications services\" rather than their current status as \"information services\". They "}

The reality, she says, is that China is spending as much as the US and Europe put together on clean power. She says its coal-fired power stations are state of the art - and should be copied in other developing countries. Maria van der Hoeven told BBC News: \"People think about China in a way more representative of previous decades. \"They are now the largest wind power market in the world. They have increased their power generation from renewables from really nothing 10 years ago - and now it's 25%. These are very important signals that China is moving into the right direction.\" Her organisation - the rich countries' energy think-tank - says in 2014 that China spent more than $80bn in new renewables generating capacity; higher than the EU ($46bn); Japan ($37bn) and the USA ($34bn). China's commitment to renewables has benefited the rest of the world by creating a mass market that prompted a 70% reduction in the cost of solar panels in recent years. The country is also building 50 new nuclear power stations and creating economies of scale in nuclear too, the IEA says, at a time when the industry is moribund in Europe.

However, the very next Fermat number 232 + 1 is composite (one of its prime factors is 641), as Euler discovered later, and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime.

Vydra had a header well saved by Ali Al-Habsi soon after in a game of few clear-cut chances. George Evans hammered home from six yards in the final minute after Roy Beerens' corner was not cleared. Former Charlton boss Powell, who served as Nigel Pearson's number two at Derby, has taken over after the manager was suspended pending a club investigation into his behaviour. He saw his side almost go behind in first-half stoppage time as Yann Kermogant's powerful header was well saved by Scott Carson. But Vydra scored for the first time since moving to Derby for a club-record fee at the end of August, flicking home after Christie's poor free-kick. Had Vydra converted his header 12 minutes later, Powell would have been celebrating a perfect record in charge of Derby, having won at Cardiff on Tuesday. But Evans capitalised after the away defence made a mess of clearing Beerens' corner. The Rams, who have won only once in their past 10 games, are two points above the relegation zone, while Reading are eighth. Reading manager Jaap Stam: \"I was happy with a point at the end. We knew that we would have to be patient and we were patient. \"After going 1-0 down, it was very difficult to get back into the game because we knew Derby would be dropping back even more and waiting for the counter-attack to score a second goal. \"We had to be aware of that and eventually we scored the equaliser, which I think we deserved.

Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981\u20131037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt."}

Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations, or mergers, and the abuse of a dominant position by companies. This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law.

Nokia no longer manufactures phones that carry its name but has instead licensed its brand to another Finnish company, HMD Global. Until now, the only phones that had been released under the deal had been more basic \"feature phone\" models. The Android device had been highly anticipated and marks Nokia's return to the smartphone market after a series of Windows Phone models. Microsoft briefly used the brand for about a year after buying Nokia's mobile devices unit in 2014. Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system. HMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017. It is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February. \"The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,\" the firm said in a statement. \"With over 552 million smartphone users in China in "}

The real estate tycoon's camp refused to confirm or deny the report, but said the filing was \"illegally obtained\". The campaign of his rival, Hillary Clinton, called it a \"bombshell\". But the Republican presidential nominee's surrogates took to the airwaves on Sunday morning to defend him. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said the New York Times article was a \"very good story\" because it showcased the \"genius\" of Mr Trump. Mr Christie told Fox News Sunday the report would only underline that Mr Trump is best qualified to ease tax policy on working people. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter There's no evidence at this point that Mr Trump did anything improper. Just because it's legal, however, doesn't mean this revelation isn't potentially damaging. First, Mr Trump has staked his campaign on being a savvy businessman, and posting a financial loss so large that his tax accountant's software couldn't process the number could undermine that claim. Then there's the fact that Mr Trump has, over the years, condemned prominent Americans,\u00ad including Barack Obama and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, for not paying enough taxes. Now he looks like a hypocrite. Hotel impresario Leona Helmsley once famously said that \"only little people pay taxes\" - and she was excoriated for it. Americans know the wealthy have a multitude of ways to avoid taxes. Knowing is different from seeing the cold, hard evidence, however. At the very least, this latest revelation once again puts Mr Trump on his heels in the final weeks of the presidential campaign. Rudy Giuliani, a close adviser to Mr Trump, also said the Republican nominee was an \"absolute genius\" if he avoided federal income taxes. \"A "}

Fertilization is generally external, although platyctenids' eggs are fertilized inside their parents' bodies and kept there until they hatch. The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids, gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow. The exceptions are the beroids, whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles, and the platyctenids, whose young live as cydippid-like plankton until they reach near-adult size, but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.

The book is absolutely right that many trail running shoes of the past were astoundingly overbuilt, however, I have yet to see anybody win a competitive trail ultra while running barefoot, or wearing sandals, or FiveFingers, or some other iteration of the barefoot scene. While barefoot running is totally valid as a way to be strong and healthy, the science seems to indicate that the vast majority of people need some underfoot protection when running long distances. As for the young guys who were cutting all the padding out of their shoes and running super long distances, I can think of two in particular, one of whom races infrequently, at best, due to injuries and the other is now a farmer and hasn't raced in years."}

In modern terms, objective Islam can be referred to as political Islam, which is a dogmatic belief in eternal strife \u2014 jihad \u2014 for the universal unification of Islam and the state. Subjective Islam is represented by the Sufis and all other Muslims who believe in religion as a personal stance or a set of convictions; it separates faith from the state or officialdom. My concept of hudna and tahdi'a is based on the above distinction and interpretation of the two Islams."}

A jury found the former nurse guilty of homicide by child abuse the day before and she could have faced up to life behind bars.Her lawyer said she will appeal and it's likely the case will be tied up for years to come. Both the prosecutor and Greene's lawyer agree no mother has ever been prosecuted in the United States for killing her child through a substance transmitted in breast milk.Greene's daughter Alexis was born healthy, but was found dead in her parents' bed just 46 days after she was born in November 2010.An autopsy found a level of morphine in the baby's body that a pathologist testified could have been lethal for an adult. With no needle marks on the child's body, authorities decided the drugs must have gotten into the infant through her mother's milk, prosecutor Barry Barnette said.A review of her medical records showed Greene carefully hid her pregnancy from her primary doctor.

In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging.

It includes appeals to government ministers and could see changes to the law. As well as eight \"reasonable precautions\" which could have prevented the crash - all relating to Mr Clarke's health - the sheriff outlined 19 recommendations which could reduce the chances of such an incident recurring in future. BBC Scotland reporter Philip Sim, who covered the inquiry at Glasgow Sheriff Court, examined the sheriff's determination. Sheriff Beckett's job at the fatal accident inquiry was to establish the basic facts of what happened on 22 December, 2014, and what could be done to prevent such a tragedy happening again. He ruled that John and Lorraine Sweeney, Erin McQuade, Stephenie Tait, Gillian Ewing and Jacqueline Morton died due to the \"loss of control\" of a Glasgow City Council bin lorry by driver Harry Clarke. Mr Clarke lost control after suffering an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope - \"he fainted\" - and the vehicle mounted the pavement on Queen Street, which was busy with pedestrians and Christmas shoppers. Inside, crewman Matthew Telford shouted, \"you're killing people Harry\". Accelerating to speeds of up to 26.09mph, the lorry collided with pedestrians, buildings and cars before crashing into the Millenium Hotel less than 20 seconds later.

Canon Peter McBride, who led the Requiem Mass, told mourners gathered: 'Stephenie brought order, organisation, good humour and a sense of calm into family life, her teaching career, her parish ministry, and into her friendships.'

GravelleThis paper reviews the current evidence on the incidence of the corporate tax from Harberger-type general equilibrium models, with special attention to the open economy. The analysis identifies the major drivers of the results from open-economy models and compares estimates from four major studies that have examined corporate tax incidence in an open economy. The studies vary in the assumptions of critical elasticities, and the variations account for differences in the reported estimates. Adjusting the estimates from the studies to reflect central empirical estimates of key elasticities suggests that capital bears the majority of the corporate tax burden. This paper details drawbacks to the use of these models, such as their focus on the long-run when the adjustment from the short-run could be very long.The paper also presents an alternative method for allocating the corporate tax burden. The proposed method draws on the new view of incidence of the property tax and, in a similar fashion, distinguishes between the global effects of corporate taxes and excise effects that vary among nations. In this view, capital bears the"}

The world knew Clark and Superman were the same person.As I moved onto Action , I knew we should deal with that right away.

However, the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of \"\"Pre-Code\"\" films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put out--even if they aren't married and even if their partner IS!! <br /><br />The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI. In the process, she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who eventually convinces her to sleep with him. She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne does NOT want him back, as she realizes he's not worth it, but later her baby dies at child birth. While all these very controversial plot elements are used, they are always alluded to--almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way, kids in the audience will be clueless (after all, films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time).<br /><br />Surprisingly, this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to.

However, 7-1/2 decades later, it's being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today. Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts.<br /><br />As for the Stooges, this is a film from there very early days--before MGM had any idea what to do with the team. At this point, they were known as \"\"Ted Healy and his Stooges\"\" as Healy was the front man. Fortunately for the Stooges, they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man (read up on him--you'll see what I mean) and the rest is history. Within a year, they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team. This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM, a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy (such as the films of Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello and others). In fact, up until they left for Columbia, MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles--including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY. And, oddly, in this film they didn't act as a team--they just did various supporting roles, such as Larry playing the piano!<br /><br />This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle. When they are rescued and brought home, all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show--punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there.

There are some things we need to bear in mind when trying to answer this question. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has visited an astonishing 37 countries since becoming president in 2013 - but the DPRK has so far not been one of them. The DPRK has reciprocated, with young leader Kim Jong-un not once taking the short, hour-long plane ride to Beijing since his elevation in 2011. We also know that in the last 10 years, Chinese condemnation of the three previous nuclear tests has grown increasingly pointed and blunt. The Beijing Ministry of Foreign Affairs this time curtly announced that it \"strongly opposed\" the DPRK's suspected testing of a hydrogen bomb.

Hodgson then removed man of the match Wayne Rooney, who had earlier seen a shot pushed superbly on to the post by Akinfeev, and replaced him with Jack Wilshere to preserve England's advantage. It was a move that failed when Russia snatched a point - and extended England's record of never starting a European Championship with a win - two minutes into four minutes of stoppage time, Berezutski soaring above Danny Rose at the far post to send Georgi Schennikov's header looping over keeper Joe Hart. The final whistle was the cue for more of the violence that has marred the build-up to this fixture, as Russian fans appeared to charge at English supporters behind the goal where Berezutski scored. England manager Roy Hodgson got plenty right with a positive selection and the decision to play Rooney in midfield reaped a rich reward - but his boldest move may also have been his biggest mistake. He removed Rooney straight after Dier's goal and introduced Wilshere in an attempt to retain possession, but Rooney was the player giving England control and while it was a warm night in the south of France, the 30-year-old looked fresh and fit for the fight. True, it was a sucker punch that cost England victory but experience is needed to close out crucial wins and ultimately they did not manage it. England should have had enough against a very ordinary Russia to complete the job but Rooney's removal robbed them of his craft and guidance and now increases the pressure on Thursday's meeting with Wales in Lens. In Hodgson's defence, it must be stated that in large parts this was a vibrant, energetic performance with the emphasis almost exclusively on attack. England were hugely impressive in the first half in particular, when their supporters inside this magnificent bowl at Stade Velodrome roared their approval as Russia were pressed into submission and made to look pedestrian. It made that cruel conclusion even more painful. Rooney was the subject of some mischievous probing from the Russia media before the game as they suggested his retreat into midfield "}

With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste, Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for \"ecological crimes\". The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission. That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law \u2013 something never done before. So far, the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive. Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence, but was rejected at vote.

At dinner on the first night\u2014as Bill White, a seventy-one-year-old Vietnam veteran, ambled across the far end of the dining room on crutches and a prosthetic leg, and Jeff Bauman tooled around in his wheelchair with his trademark knit cap atop his head\u2014the Lus could hardly muster a smile or even a nod.

But many of them did not open because entrepreneurs were discovering a new niche. These trucks belong to people who have lost their jobs and used their compensation money to start a new business. In fact, on weekdays, most food trucks are just parked around town and closed as there aren't many customers. In just under two years, this city of 239,000 saw about 22,000 jobs disappear. Many of the unemployed who did not buy food trucks or venture into new business simply left town. Macae is one of the many cities on Brazil's south-east coast that has seen its dreams of oil-spurred wealth destroyed by the cruel reality of the country's oil crisis that started in 2014. Brazil's oil reserves are buried deep beneath the seabed, miles from the coast. So places like Macae are home to a large number of people who work on the offshore oil platforms and drilling ships. Since the 1970s, when Brazil's state oil giant Petrobras started its offshore operations here, this sleepy fishing town has seen an influx of highly skilled workers, such as engineers, chemists and professional divers. Anita Gomide and her husband started their commercial diving firm Tecsubsea in 2011 to service the oil platforms. During the good years, they would have up to two jobs a week - each of them requiring a team of at least three divers. But now they say they are lucky to get one job a month. \"Every six months we sit down and consider shutting down our company,\" says Anita. \"Then we decide, 'Let's just carry on for six months more and see what happens.' We've been doing this for a long time.\" Tecsubsea is still operating, but many of its competitors have dropped out. The upside of this crisis, Anita jokes, is that Macae is now a much nicer place to live, with less traffic and more affordable housing. At the local port, most commercial boats that service the oil industry are anchored in the dock. The only vessels in high demand are the fishing ones. Evanildo Faria, of Patricia Mar"}

It was the first in a trilogy (unfinished, of course) about three friends who find an evil monster lurking in the sewers beneath their church. There were shadowy characters, adventures into the unknown, heroism, and monsters. Now, while my book went into a much more spiritual-warfare, mythology realm with demons and angels and minotaurs and labyrinths, the heart of the story was the adventure.I had been influenced by reading the Harry Potter books and they were just so incredibly fun to read.

Once he's happy with the features and all, he'll make sure it finds its way to the core.

Many of the delegates will stay in swish hotels nearby. This is the third such London gathering since 2012, and there is an element of \"cut and paste\" to its agenda, which focuses on security, governance and the economy. The official conference document emphasises how much progress has been made. But its description of Somalia from the time of the first meeting still applies: \"Chronically unstable and ungoverned\", and threatened by Islamist militants, piracy and famine. There has been some improvement. Piracy, which at its height cost $7bn (\u00c2\u00a35.4bn) a year, is much diminished, although there has been a recent resurgence. US drones, African Union troops, Western \"security advisers\" and Somali forces have pushed al-Shabab from most major towns, although the jihadists still control many areas and attack at will. A recent electoral process resulted in a new and - for the time being - popular president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, nicknamed Farmajo, and more female and youth representation in parliament. Somalia is in a \"pre-famine\" stage rather than the full-blown disaster of 2011, in which more than 250,000 people died. But it is perhaps surprising that the current water shortage will not be a headline topic at the conference. The country is in the grip of its worst drought in decades. Four successive rainy seasons have failed.

One boy, dressed in purple, stares blankly at the wall. \"His brain is damaged due to a prolonged lack of adequate nutrition,\" says Dr Yusuf Ali, who returned home to Somalia from the UK two years ago. \"He will never recover.\" According to Unicef, the number of children who are or will be acutely malnourished in 2017 is up by 50% from the beginning of the year, to a total of 1.4 million, including 275,000 for whom the condition is or will be life-threatening.

James Keatings and another for Cummings were added in quick succession in the second half. It leaves Ayr at the bottom, three points behind next week's hosts, who lost 5-0 to St Mirren. Ayr looked nervous, but Neil Lennon's visitors started the game with intent and came close after only three minutes. Cummings sensed an opportunity after a mistake from the Ayr defence, but his right-footed effort came back out off the post. The striker was hungry for a goal and, following some skilful footwork by John McGinn, the midfielder whipped in a cross for Cumming to nod it home. It was two shortly after as Grant Holt's low cross was met at the back post by the oncoming Boyle to slide the ball under goalkeeper Greg Fleming. The second half was more of the same. McGinn and Boyle both came close with long distance efforts and Holt came inches away from connecting with a cut-back six yards out. Hibs' third came when McGinn found Cummings in space on the right and a simple ball set up well-positioned substitute Keatings to slip the ball through the legs of Fleming. Cummings wasn't done for the day and added his second and Hibs' fourth after Keatings turned supplier with a delightful through ball. Ian McCall's hosts rarely threatened, with visiting goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw equal to efforts from Michael Rose and Daryll Meggat when they did get a glimpse of goal. Ayr United manager Ian McCall: \"I think if we win 5-0 we might stay up or go into a play-off, but that's not really the point. \"I thought in the first half we were awful and we looked nervous"}

This acts like a decorator around the parameter object because it wraps around it and adds to its functionality from the outside (in this case sends a notification after the action is performed).The reason why the decorator must implement the same interface is to make sure it has the same public API as the decorated one.

Also, this past week, McNeill spoke at the Belron conference in Lisbon. In both talks, McNeill revealed some unique insights into Tesla's business forecasts. McNeill joined Tesla last fall after his former role as CEO of Enservio where he was named \"Most Admired CEO\" by the Boston Business Journal . Before that, McNeill co-founded Sterling Collision Centers where he was able to reduce industry repair times by 90% (from 18 days to less than 2 days) while simultaneously growing the business at more than 40% per year. We've been excited to hear more from McNeill and he's delivered some intriguing information in these recent talks.Image: MissionlineAt the International Fleet Meeting, McNeill addressed company targets at the Tesla Gigafactory: \"Our aim there [at the Gigafactory] is to reduce the cost of the battery - which is the largest cost in the car - by half.\" McNeill's estimate for a 50% decrease in battery pack cost differs from prior forecasts from Tesla (see slide from prior 2013 Tesla presentation below) that officially state a 30% decrease in battery pack cost. Since 2013, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and co-founder JB Straubel have repeatedly used the 30% target"}

Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace."}

In hindsight, perhaps I should have just turned it off then! Fonda is knocked out in the fall and Barbara goes for help.

A well known limitation of this pattern and one of the main arguments for the composition over inheritance principle is that it cannot be extended to import methods from different classes (unless of course your language offers multiple inheritance). That's why the compositional equivalent is often presented as a better practice:class Baz : Foo { Bar bar; void doSomething() { this.bar.doSomething(); } }Rust has no type inheritance (not yet?) but composition can of course be used in a similar manner:trait Foo { fn do_something(&self); } impl Foo for Bar { fn do_something(&self) { ... } } struct Baz { ... bar : Bar } impl Foo for Baz { fn do_something(&self) { bar.do_something(); } }Now the main drawback for this pattern in Rust and in most OO languages is the boilerplate implied.

Now, after eight increasingly successful years at Edgbaston, the last six of them as an automatic Bears first-team choice, the left-arm all-rounder could have another big decision to make. England or West Indies? \"I've been asked it a lot over the years,\" Barker told BBC Sport. \"Would I play for England or the West Indies? But nothing has been approached to me about it.\" At 29, it now looks increasingly clear that England are never going to consider him - despite a lot of plaudits on the back of an almost unrivalled haul of 257 wickets in 70 County Championship games since 2012. But there is another option open to this Lancastrian son of a West Indian, whose godfather is the great Clive Lloyd. Could he really play for the Windies? \"I'd be open to it obviously,\" said Barker. \"But it would be a possible lifestyle change. I'd probably have to up and move. I couldn't just walk straight into the squad. You have to play so many games - and I'd have to perform in them too. \"I've no issue with not being selected by England. They might see me only as being a good county player and that's fine as I never even thought I'd do that in the first place. \"I'm proud to have achieved what I have. I don't want to look back thinking I could have done more. If I was to be given some sort of recognition internationally, it would have most likely happened by now.

And, as a Lancastrian son of a West Indian, Keith Barker Jr he admits he was born to play cricket. \"I'm told I had a cricket bat in my hand before I could walk,\" said Manchester-born Barker, who grew up in Accrington, while his father was professional at various nearby Lancashire League clubs, including Great Harwood, Enfield and Rishton. \"I was always playing with my brothers,\" he recalls. \"We used to play on the driveway when it was sunny, with a skateboard for stumps, leaned up against the garage door. \"I played my first Under-13s game at the age of six when one lad didn't turn up, I trialled with Lancashire Under-11s at eight and, at one point, we had all four of us brothers playing for Enfield, "}

Gabrielsson visited the Californian company Glasspar to talk about a new sports car. Glasspar was a company which made glass-fibre bodies for boats and cars, like the Chevrolet Corvette (the most popular car of the USA which has a glass-fibre body). Gabrielsson told Glasspar to develop a new sports car on a PV444-chassis, running gear and the new B14B 70bhp engine. The design drawings (Gabrielsson thought Volvo needed a sports car to boost up the sales of the PV) were actually completed before Gabriellson left the USA.Bill Tritt (Glasspar) working on a clay scale model of the car that would become the Volvo P1900At the end of 1953 Glasspar finished two protoypes (designed by Bill Tritt): a convertible and a coup\u00e9.

Art by TikitikWhat is Mix and Mega?In a nutshell, Mix and Mega is a metagame where any fully evolved OU-legal Pok\u00e9mon can hold any Mega Stone. Upon Mega Evolving, they get the stat, changes, new typing (if applicable), and ability that the stone would give the original holder. For example, the Altarianite gives Altaria base stats of 75/110/110/110/105/85, grants it a secondary Fairy typing, and changes its ability to Pixilate. This translates to a +40 boost to Attack, a +20 boost to Defense, and a +40 boost to Special Attack. So, if you gave Landorus-T the Altarianite, its base stats would become 89/185/110/145/80/91, it would become a Ground / Fairy-type, and it would gain Pixilate. Click here for an easy-to-view list of what Mega Stone does what. You activate the Mega Stone the same way you would ordinarily, by clicking the Mega Evolve button, and you can Mega Evolve as many Pok\u00e9mon on your team as you wish. The boosts remain until the Pok\u00e9mon faints. The Red Orb and Blue Orb activate immediately, as they would on Groudon and Kyogre.

But the goal is natural conversation, and it could be a huge step. If what Facebook has promised today at its F8 developer conference comes to pass, the effect on our everyday lives could be enormous. It could be, according to Facebook's head of messaging David Marcus, a return to more personal interactions. \"Before the internet era, everything was conversational,\" he told the BBC. \"But then we traded conversations for scale.\" One of the bots being launched on the service today will be from Spring, an artificially intelligent concierge service. \"Spring is actually going to build an experience where everything is automated except customer service,\" Mr Marcus explained. \"It's bot for 99.9%, but then if you have a problem, a human can actually jump in and sort out your problem. \"That's the best of both worlds.\" There are obvious concerns to all this, and I'll get to those in a second, but first here's how it will work.

An API is a way for companies like Facebook to give external developers the access and know-how to make things on their platforms.

The packets are routed individually, sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery. Each packet is labeled with a destination address, source address, and port numbers. It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet. This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number. Thus a virtual connection, also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the end-user by a transport layer protocol, although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service."}

Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.<br /><br />Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film. There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated. While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious"}

Over the long-term, this trend increases the organic composition of capital, meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs, increasing unemployment (the \"reserve army of labour\"). This process exerts a downward pressure on wages. The substitution of capital equipment for labor (mechanization and automation) raises the productivity of each worker, resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class."}

During a visit to Birmingham to announce the railway investment,  the PM said it would lead to the electrification of an extra 850 miles of track. He said: \"This investment will mean faster journeys, more seats, better access to stations, greater freight links and a truly world-class rail network.\" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who joined the PM on the visit, said the plans would help \"close the north south divide\".

These include: Building work on the rail projects will not start until at least 2014, as the announcement covers the period 2014 to 2019. The government said it would be funded \"in part from fare rises already announced in 2010 and also from the substantial efficiency savings which projects like electrification will have on the long-term operating costs of the railways\". In January this year, passengers faced average increases of RPI inflation plus 1% on regulated fares, which are set to rise by RPI plus 3% in January 2013 and 14. Transport Secretary Justine Greening told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had a long-term plan to make the rail industry work more efficiently and stop the above-inflation fare rises. \"We've got to get the money from somewhere so, for the time being, the passengers are paying,\" she said. \"We all know that diesel is massively expensive so if we can move over to electric trains, not only are they greener, they're also cheaper"}

The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each.

Kuroe so far only thinks of Misaki as a child and wants to protect her from the dangers of vampires with malicious intent.Another enjoyable part of this story is that as a viewer you would \"sometimes\" get to see the thoughts of Misaki and her feelings for Kuroe, which are further implied through her actions.

A smarter city may mean one that uses data on traffic to ease congestion or one that aims to join up services to provide better information for citizens. For many it is about making cities greener and more efficient. Technology firms such such as IBM and Cisco see smart cities as a huge business opportunity but, alongside the schemes being touted by technology firms, are more grass root projects which aim to empower citizens and allow them a say in how the city will look. Here, we look at some of the most talked-about projects: Songdo in South Korea, is - for many - the poster boy of the smart city. The $35bn (\u00c2\u00a323bn) project, located on reclaimed land near the Yellow Sea, was widely considered to be a model for smart cities around the globe when it was started in 2005. Also known as a ubiquitous city or U-city, Songdo's information systems are all linked to each other. It has led critics to dub it a \"city in a box\" - a showcase for technology but not necessarily the ideal city for people. Sensors are on everything in Songdo - for example, escalators only move when someone is on them. Every home has a telepresence system built in like a dishwasher. As well as allowing users to control the heating systems and locks, it offers video conferencing and is intended as a way to deliver education, health care and government services. Offices and schools are also connected to the network. The digital mastermind behind Songdo is Cisco, which supplies all the network-based technologies.

A portable scanner, the size of a tennis ball, is plugged into the computer's USB port and uses near-infra-red light to check the unique pattern of veins inside the finger. Only a living finger is accepted by the scanner, reducing the risk that fraudsters will use substitutes or copies to break into a bank account. Banks are casting around for new ways to combat fraud, as users become increasingly fed up with multiple passwords and PINs, or having to use electronic number generators whenever they log on. The new finger vein technique has been pioneered by the Japanese firm Hitachi. It is already installed in cash machines in Japan and Poland, allowing people to withdraw money without using a card or PIN. Any business adopting the technology can register several fingers from different members of staff, so one person can make a payment and another can approve it. The unit can be plugged into different computers. When an attempt is made to log on to the account, the user is invited to \"place a finger lightly on the scanner\", and "}

The raw transaction API gives you a lot of power and flexibility, but it's also more cumbersome and, if used incorrectly, you can accidentally lose lots of money.Why do those features need the raw transaction API?The raw transaction API is useful for a few reasons. First, it lets you create and sign transactions independently from broadcasting them. That means you can create and sign a name_firstupdate transaction before its preceding name_new transaction has been broadcast. Second, it gives you direct control over the inputs, outputs, and fees for the transaction, whereas the standard name commands instead pick defaults for you that you might not like and can't change.What's wrong with Namecoin Core's raw transaction API?It's not raw "}

The idea that Wales should have its own seat on the NEC has been around for some time. Alun Michael used it as part of his Welsh Labour leadership campaign in 1988. It will now happen, but only after a close vote and a long debate over how the Welsh representative should be chosen. He or she will now be a \"frontbench\" member of the Welsh Assembly, chosen by the party leader in Wales. (Carwyn Jones can currently attend NEC meetings but has no voting rights). The vote was close - 16 to 15 - because supporters of Jeremy Corbyn thought it better that the Welsh rep be chosen by rank-and-file members who might be more in tune with his philosophy than someone chosen by the Welsh party leadership. Welsh Labour will also now take responsibility for its own elections, so the electoral college is likely to survive. One member one vote, with supporters able to pay to take part, is widely seen as key to the election of Jeremy Corbyn and few in the Welsh Labour hierarchy want to repeat the experiment when Carwyn Jones moves on. The leader of Welsh Labour will also get the right to attend \"Clause V\" meetings, where the Labour general election manifesto is signed off.

But some of those comments also made it apparent that there is a fair amount of confusion regarding the details of the conference's television rights, particularly third tier rights, and what impact they will likely have on the conference's future.It ultimately comes down to the fact that ACC schools do not retain third tier rights for football or basketball games, a sacrifice that was not rewarded with comparable rights fees to those paid to the other \"major\" conferences. That does not mean that ACC schools are entirely without valuable media rights, but it puts the conference at a significant disadvantage and has led schools like Florida State and Clemson to consider leaving the ACC for another conference.To quickly cover the basics: there are three tiers of media rights. The first and second tiers are generally controlled by the conferences, which sell them - either separately or combined - to national networks like ABC/ESPN, CBS and Fox. The first tier rights holder gets first pick of the conference's televised sporting events, usually for over-the-air broadcasts.

Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense.

During 7-on-7 drills, the 6-2, 206 pound Smith jumped a route and intercepted a pass from Joe Flacco intended for wide receiver Kamar Aiken.On the very next play, Smith was inches away from another interception when the pass was tipped at the very last moment.Smith also was responsible for several passes defended through the morning practice.Not Flacco's DayDespite a long touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Darren Waller and Michael Campanaro, Joe Flacco didn't have the best day. During 11-on-11 drills, Flacco was picked off twice once by Asa Jackson and another by Anthony Levine Sr., often throwing behind his intended receivers.A number of passes required his receivers to dive for the football while others were batted away or nearly intercepted by the Ravens secondary.Backup quarterback Matt Schaub's performance was better than his previous outings, however he was also the victim of the energized secondary.The Butler Did ItOne player the"}

You can be a good hitter while making contact at around 67-68% of the time, as long as you have elite power, which Stanton obviously has.But he's currently at 62%. Here's the full list of players who have posted a contact rate that low"}

A 1970s boom largely benefited the middle classes, but a subsequent price collapse condemned many of them to poverty while eroding the living standards of the already impoverished. Unemployment is high and, according to official figures, around 60% of households are poor. In 1998 Venezuelans broke with the party system to elect populist left-winger Hugo Chavez, a former army officer who proclaimed a \"Bolivarian revolution\", named after South America's independence hero. Mr Chavez died in 2013, but was succeeded by his vice-president, Nicolas Maduro, who pledged to continue his policies. Socialist reform, political unrest and deep divisions characterised President Chavez's term in office. His supporters - known as \"chavistas\" - and his detractors both staged street protests. Venezuela profile - home Country profiles - home Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring Supporters said his economic reforms - including the nationalisation of much of the economy, especially the oil sector - and his expansion of social programmes helped the poor benefit from the country's oil export revenues. Critics say Chavista policies have harmed economic performance.

Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L)."}

For the 11-year-olds sitting their national curriculum tests, often known as Sats, in England this week, the emphasis is on mental arithmetic. Calculators are no longer permitted. Their use will also be limited in the new GCSE maths exams, for which students will start studying this autumn. Dictionaries have had a similarly chequered track record in foreign language exams. They were banned 15 years ago, after research suggested they gave the brightest students a greater advantage. Newly redrafted GCSEs in French, Spanish and German will be introduced in 2016. As part of its recent consultation on the exam, the regulator Ofqual has asked about the ban on dictionaries. In the responses, opinion was divided, suggesting this is not a settled debate. In different ways, these are all dilemmas about the boundary between knowledge and understanding, between retrieving information and manipulating it. And with search engines, it is very much a digital conundrum. Imagine for a moment the pre-digital equivalent - allowing students to roam through a vast library. They simply would not have time to find the references they needed and return to their desk to complete the exam. Now unimaginable amounts of information lie at our fingertips. But does the act of memorising and then recalling information mould our brains in a different way?

The project envisages excavating the shallow sea between the Palk Bay and the Gulf of Mannar to create a narrow shipping passage, linking the east and west coasts of India and obviating the current 'hassle' of circumnavigating Sri Lanka to reach the eastern coast of India (and vice-versa).The total length of the channel is estimated to be 152.2 km. Creating it will require two phases of dredging (or even blasting, depending on the nature of the substratum) the 20-km-long coral-reef platform known as 'Adam's Bridge' or 'Ram Sethu', as some like to call it, and the 54-km long Bay of Bengal segments. The third segment falls in the Palk Bay, with a total length of 78 km and which reportedly requires no dredging as this area has a clearance depth of 12 m.Sethusamudram, as the name suggests, is that part of the ocean being constantly bridged by natural sedimentation processes. Like the Great Barrier Reef off of the northeast coast of Australia, Ram Sethu is a continuous stretch of limestone shoals that runs from the Pamban island near Rameswaram to Mannar Island off of the northern coast of Sri Lanka. Because the ocean floor is shallow in this area, natural processes have formed coral platforms here for millions of years.During a glaciation period 20,000 years ago, many parts of the Indian coast including, parts of "}

His political career started in the Virginia House of Delegates, where he served 15 years. In 2005, he was elected Attorney General for the state, edging out his opponent Creigh Deeds by a mere 323 votes. Four years later, McDonnell ran for governor and bested Deeds again, campaigning on a \"Bob's for Jobs\" platform and overcoming criticisms about his socially conservative views.While McDonnell was initially viewed as a future presidential contender, a blockbuster March 2013 investigative report from the Washington Post's Rosalind Helderman and Laura Vozzella put those hopes in serious doubt. The reporters revealed that businessman Jonnie Williams paid for $15,000 of catering at McDonnell's daughter's wedding, and chronicled the efforts of the first couple to help Williams' company. A federal criminal investigation was underway, and it turned up evidence of many more undisclosed gifts. In January 2014, only days after leaving office, McDonnell and his wife were each indicted on 13 counts, 11 of which were corruption charges.Why was McDonnell indicted and"}

Ms Hutt said: \"The late timing of the spending review makes the challenge of managing the impact of further austerity even greater. \"\u00a320bn cuts to public spending on top of \u00a312bn of welfare cuts set out earlier this month.\" \"Cuts on the back of successive reductions to our Budget over the last five years have seen \u00a31.3bn taken out of vital public services in Wales,\" Ms Hutt added.

Granata and his partner, Jennifer Peaston, had met the backpacker at a party in November 2012 and invited her to their hotel room. The backpacker was forced to live in the shower. Granata, with the help of Peaston, beat the woman with various objects including a meat tenderiser and rolling pin, and performed bizarre rituals on her.

DirecTV has offered NFL Ticket free to new subscribers for one season.About 2 million die-hard fans pay $199 a year for the football package, on top of their regular subscription fee.

Under the deal the US will cede control of Bagram over six months. Reports say they will retain access and be able to block the release of certain detainees. Handing over US-run jails has been a key demand of Afghan President Hamid Karzai ahead of Nato's withdrawal. Analysts say the issue has cast a shadow over negotiations on Nato's withdrawal of all of its combat forces by the end of 2014 and the long-term relationship with Afghanistan. Bagram prison, officially known as the Parwan Detention Centre, is located in one of the largest military bases for Nato-led forces in Afghanistan. It has been at the centre of a number of prisoner abuse allegations in recent years. Nato is also under intense pressure after days of protests and targeted killings across Afghanistan - over the inadvertent burning of Korans at Bagram - left at least 30 people dead. The US repeatedly apologised over the incident but that failed to quell public anger. Correspondents say the deal is the first stage of a mechanism which is still being worked out but will eventually see US-run jails handed over to full Afghan control. By Bilal SarwaryBBC News, Kabul US military officials in Kabul told the media that the Afghan government would take charge of about 500 prisoners at the detention centre within 45 days.

It seemed a natural conclusion. \"After Rio, I did some different things, work experience up in London to experience real life.

The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was, the fact that David ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film, and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene.

There is also tension in the Sofia suburb of Orlandovci, where a smaller number of houses inhabited by Roma are slated for destruction. Human rights groups accuse the government of bowing to the nationalists, and of risking wider conflicts between Roma and non-Roma Bulgarians. Nationalist politicians, and residents who support the demolitions, say the law until now turned a blind eye to illegal construction if Roma were involved. Regional Development Minister Lilyana Pavlova said last week that 8 of the 124 illegal buildings in Garmen had already been demolished, and she was waiting for the local council to provide a timetable for the rest. Between 5-10% of Bulgaria's 7.4 million people are of ethnic Roma background. Bulgaria is the poorest EU member state, and many people - Roma and non-Roma, rich and poor - live in buildings that could be classified as illegal. Garmen's Mayor Minka Kapetanova says she is caught in a vicious circle. In the mid 1960s, she told the BBC, about 20 formerly nomadic Roma were forced to settle by the Communist authorities on agricultural land on the edge of Garmen. By today, that number has multiplied to over 800, as the families had children and grandchildren. Most have residence permits, granted by the previous mayor. On 24 May, according to"}

It had said people had a right to depict the \"world in which we live\". But the US's Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) said the violent nature of the material had \"crossed a line\". \"Personally and professionally I feel that Facebook has got this call wrong,\" said Stephen Balkam, the organisation's chief executive, ahead of the U-turn. Charities in the UK had also called on the social network to reconsider its stance saying the material could cause long-term psychological damage. The warnings came after a one-minute long video was uploaded to the site last week showing a woman being beheaded by a masked man. A voice heard on the footage suggests that it was filmed in Mexico. A second video clip showing the execution of two men has also been shared on the network after being posted last Wednesday. The victims say they are drug smugglers for a Mexican cartel before being attacked with a chainsaw and knife. Ryan L, a university student from Belfast, contacted the BBC after one of the clips spread around his friends' news feeds. He said he had flagged the material with Facebook as being inappropriate, but was sent the following reply. \"Thanks for your report.

Ian Wright, its director general, described Brexit as the UK's \"most significant peacetime challenge ever\". He said foreign industry workers needed to know they were wanted: \"The immediate priority for those workers is to support them through this deeply unpleasant climate of 'anti-foreigner' sentiment and to provide them with speedy reassurance that their future here is absolutely secure and their contribution is valued and warmly welcomed.\" He said he was deeply worried about access to the single market and EU workers, adding that many manufacturers would struggle to substitute existing EU customers for ones in other parts of the world because of differing consumer tastes and limited product shelf life. The FDF represents over 6,000 businesses with a workforce of nearly 400,000. At the Federation's first convention, Mr Wright said it was imperative that the industry had the ability to trade across the 27 EU nations without being impeded by tariffs if it was to remain competitive.

The body that oversees Catholic education in Northern Ireland, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS), has said all schools should remain open, if not for children, then for teachers and other staff who do not want to strike. However, with canteen and bus and train staff likely to take action, some schools have asked only senior and exam classes to come in, using alternative transport. They have told pupils to bring packed lunches as school catering staff may be involved in industrial action. Parents should liaise with schools regarding attendance on Friday and consider making alternative arrangements to get children to school where possible.

But how bad is it, exactly? Here are some reasons why it could be a grievous wound - or nothing but a scratch. Explanations dismantled. Mrs Clinton had a carefully constructed series of justifications and defences for her email decisions while secretary of state. James Comey's unusual press conference exploded like a torpedo beneath the water line, sinking those efforts. Mrs Clinton said she hadn't sent classified information. The FBI found more than 100 of her 30,000 emails (0.3%) contained details that were classified \"at the time\" they were transmitted and \"a very small number\" had markings \"indicating the presence of classified information\". She also said she had turned over all her work-related messages, but in fact her lawyers relied on keyword searches to sort through the email files and consequently missed several thousand relevant documents. Major media fact-checkers were quick to survey the scope of the damage. Politifact said the FBI \"clearly undercuts Clinton's defence\". The Washington Post upgraded its verdict on the veracity of Mrs Clinton's classified information claims from two to four \"Pinocchios\". The Associated Press wrote that the FBI \"left much of her account in tatters and may have aggravated questions of trust swirling around her Democratic presidential candidacy\". Polls show that many voters give Mrs Clinton low marks for veracity and openness - and these latest revelations will do nothing to help change this view. It's a lead weight holding her overall approval ratings down when she needs to be generating enthusiasm and energy for her general election campaign. Strength undermined. The Clinton team has framed much of its campaign as a contrast with Donald Trump, whom they are painting as a reckless and dangerous commander-in-chief. The former secretary of state, they counter, is tested and competent - a steady hand on the wheel in troubled times. But are steady hands labelled \"extremely careless\" with classified information by the FBI? Do they leave their personal communications open to possible \"hostile actors\", including sending emails on an unclassified system while \"in the territory of sophisticated adversaries\"? On Tuesday afternoon the Trump campaign sent a press release leading with the charge that Mrs Clinton \"compromised the safety of the American people\". \"Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton,\" he wrote, \"and that fact alone disqualifies her from service\". While there's no tangible support for that particular piece of Trump bluster, if the public doesn't buy Mrs Clinton's argument that she's the \"safe\" choice, much of the advantage she has on her sometimes intemperate opponent will disappear.

But giving up banking secrecy is likely to be a painful process for the Swiss. While other countries see the practice as a way to hide the ill-gotten profits of crime, corruption, or tax evasion, in Switzerland it is viewed as an honourable policy which illustrates the relation of trust between state and citizen. \"The origin of Swiss banking secrecy... is really a professional secrecy like that of a doctor or a lawyer,\" explains Michel DeRobert, head of the Association of Swiss Private Bankers. \"He is not supposed to give out the data of his clients, he's not supposed to repeat it to other people.\" Those who want to keep the current secrecy often claim that it was first introduced in the 1930s in order to protect German Jews, who were investing their assets in Swiss banks in order to stop the Nazis seizing them. Although this certainly happened, in fact the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 was introduced in the wake of a scandal in which a number of French politicians and businessmen were publicly identified as having hidden their money in Switzerland. The act was designed to protect client privacy in the future. If the recent events surrounding France's disgraced former budget minister Jerome Cahuzac are anything to go by, some European politicians have continued to benefit from the secrecy. Mr Cahuzac, charged with sorting out tax evasion in France, was recently revealed to have put hundreds of thousands of euros in a secret Swiss bank account, in the hope of escaping the attentions of the taxman. Examples like these are causing fury in cash-strapped European capitals. Greece, too, has seen much needed tax revenue disappear into Swiss banks, and"}

The costs to other groups in society will be modest and readily absorbed.\"The people who are harmed by an increase in the minimum wage are low-skilled workers.

Barney, the main character, is a horrendous 9-foot tall talking, purple dinosaur that teaches 13-year-olds about \"\"imagination....\"\"(*shudders*) B.J.(I know what your thinking about his name.)Is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be \"\"supposudly\"\" cool.

Baby Bop-oh-oh-god!(*vomits*)oh-oh-OH-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea of a character EVER. She is a green triceratops(it's a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. Her remarks of \"\"hee-hee-hee\"\" and Barney's praises cries of 'super-deeee-doooper\"\", make it hard to sit through each episode, as the Seventh graders learn about shapes and manners.<br /><br />And that, my friend, is what makes this show truly horrible.\""}
