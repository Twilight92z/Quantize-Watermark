Machines are turned off, staff slip away and patients settle down as the hurly, burly of the week gives way to the weekend. In one respect there is nothing wrong with this. Much of the non-emergency side of a hospital's work (knee and hip replacements for example) stops or at the very least slows at weekends. But this is not really the issue. Nor is there any real suggestion - despite the rhetoric being used - that there is no activity taking place all. After all, there are parts of the hospital where there is little let up no matter what day it is. Any member of an A&E department will tell you Friday night is one of the worst shifts as patient numbers are swollen by those who are worse for wear after a heavy night drinking. And, of course, anyone needing immediate life-saving treatment will get it. Quickly. Instead, what is at the heart of the seven-day debate is the care that lies in between these two.

And yet C-SPAN 3 did not receive Super Bowl-level viewership during its three-hour broadcast of the Comcast-TWC merger Senate hearing yesterday.Fortunately for you, dear reader, we've assembled the highlights for you:1. 'Benefits' offered by Comcast don't require merger approvalAs I wrote yesterday, Comcast made a decently convincing argument for why its merger with TWC should be approved, as long as you don't skim beneath the surface. The company's post-merger plans include an expanded low-income high-speed Internet service tier, the quick build-out of a national Wi-Fi network, no immediate change to the level of competition, and a superior set of consumer services.But sub-committee chair Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) kind of derailed much of that argument with a simple question: \"So will the benefits Comcast is offering happen even if the merger isn't approved?\"Comcast EVP David Cohen then admitted that many of those \"benefits\" were initiatives that do not depend on the merger going through. This is at least true of the national Wi-Fi network, the low-income Internet Essentials service, and improvements to current TWC subscribers' regular services (which were already in the works by TWC).2. The Southern Senator's 'revelation' about big cableI don't expect every member of the Senate to have a deep understanding of the broadband and television service industry. I do, however, expect them to at least read a Wikipedia article or two before sitting in on a judiciary hearing about the"}

You can tell that it has been an act of love for her. The acting (outside of Dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good. There was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on, though I don't feel it greatly detracts for one's ability to understand the film.

Breeders worldwide have said she is cruel to deliberately breed deformed cats. Texan laws say she is doing nothing illegal. Who is right and what are the ethics of breeding for deformity? This site is a commentary on breeding ethics - I am not a breeder of Twisty cats.Important Note: It is necessary to understand that the European and American definition of \"abnormality, \"defect\" or \"deformity\"\" differs greatly. What American breeders see as a breed trait (short legs) many European countries condemn as a deformity. What is awarded high honours in the USA may be condemned in Europe.THE ORIGINS OF SELECTIVE BREEDINGThroughout the ages, humans have been fascinated by anything that is visibly different. This is well illustrated by the vast array of modern breeds of dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs etc many of which were bred for looks rather than function. Even before full domestication, undesirable traits could have been removed from an animal population by culling certain individuals, thus removing their genes from the gene pool. After domestication, selective breeding became easier. This possibly included selective breeding for colour and shape of horns (lyre-horned cattle) which may have been important traits for religious reasons.The concept of deliberately breeding for looks is chronicled as far back as biblical times when Jacob separated spotted animals from white animals. It no doubt goes back even to prehistoric times. Perhaps our ancestors found a wolf cub which looked "}

That's an institutional decision above my paygrade, and banning him would be a merely ideological exercise. My point here is discursive. Ideology and Catholicism have a long history in this country, if not the world over. Examining how faith relates to socio- political shibboleths seems enjoined upon us in 2017. Please do keep all that in mind as you read.Vice President Mike Pence is slated to give the commencement address this year at Notre Dame. Typically, the president is asked to speak to the graduating students in the first year of his tenure. The practice seems to have begun with Eisenhower, though it only became consistent after Carter (Clinton seems to have been skipped). Forsaking President Trump was likely a strategic decision; the university didn't want a repeat of the anger directed at former-president Obama's commencement address and ex-VP Biden's receiving the Laetare Medal. Pence, considered the saner and more religious of our executive top dogs, likely presented himself as a safer choice.But is he? The furor over Obama and Biden mostly hinged on their support for abortion and same-sex marriage. The latter, a Catholic, had, in the eyes of many, practically excommunicated himself. All well and good enough: except, of course, that if such is your litmus test for a speaker, Mike Pence is an even worse candidate.Why? Some students have said that his presence will make them feel"}

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms."}

Swift then curled in a second before McCleary was sent off for shoving Barnsley captain Conor Hourihane to the ground. Adam Armstrong fired in a low shot for Barnsley late on but Reading held firm. It was a disappointing result for the Tykes, who had thrashed Wolves 4-0 at Molineux on Tuesday. Ryan Kent went close to putting them ahead when he struck the crossbar but it was the visitors who took the lead after Swift was brought down in the box by keeper Davies. Davies did well to save the penalty but was unable to deny McCleary's follow-up attempt. Following Swift's sublime finish to put Reading 2-0 up, McCleary was sent off for his reaction to a seemingly innocuous foul by Hourihane on Danny Williams. But, despite having an extra man, Barnsley struggled to create clear chances, with only Armstrong being able to find the net. Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom: \"We suffered through not getting the first goal today. Credit has to go to Reading, who played well. It was a good open game with chances at both ends, but going down 2-0 in this league is always going to make things difficult. \"We were given a lifeline in the sending-off and we will always fight right to the end and I'm glad the fans stuck with us right to the end.

Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not. For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime. On the other hand, if the test ever fails, then we know that the number is composite."}

Mulayam Singh Yadav's brother Shivpal Yadav is a minister in the state government. All SP members of the lower house of the Indian parliament are from the Yadav family. Other members occupy local and regional offices. Even though political families now dominate, or are found burrowed within most major political parties in India, no other political family has the sheer numbers and sprawl across political offices at all levels of Indian politics that the Yadav family does. Is India's politics becoming less dynastic? But last month, old tensions among the Yadavs broke out into open conflict. Akhilesh Yadav moved against his uncle Shivpal by sacking ministers and bureaucrats believed to be loyal to him. Mulayam Singh Yadav backed his brother, removing his son from the position of state president of the Samajwadi Party and appointing Shivpal Yadav to the position instead. For the past month, son and uncle and their respective factions have been fighting it out, with the patriarch playing mediator. The drama is still unfolding. As of today, several of Akhilesh Yadav's loyalists, including family members Ram Gopal Yadav and Udaiveer Yadav, have been expelled from the party, while Shivpal Yadav and his loyalists have been sacked from the cabinet. It is also not clear who the party's chief ministerial candidate is: although the SP had on 17 October named Akhilesh Yadav as its candidate for chief minister, the Shivpal Yadav faction is now proposing Mulayam Singh Yadav's name for the position.

This year we placed 95.2 percent of the animals in our care, up dramatically from 59 percent just a decade ago.Your support has fueled our progress. Over the past 12 months we've continued to invest in expanded behavior programs, advanced medical treatments, foster care, and post-adoption support to help even the most challenged animals get a second chance.We've also made strategic investments in programs and infrastructure that will help us serve even more animals beyond our shelter walls. In addition to expanding outreach and transport, we've integrated Kindest Cut and its staff into the operations of AHS. We're now providing spay/neuter and wellness services directly to pets of people in need.But that's not all we have to celebrate.

It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest.

Another senior figure put it into context: \"800km is an entire grand prix weekend in one day.\" Not everyone was charitable, though. \"It looks like they're gearing up to take that car to Le Mans,\" said one rival. \"It's admirable, but it's taking the Mickey a bit. You don't need to do that many miles.\" Perhaps not. But, at this stage of the preparations, as Hamilton put it: 'Mileage - that's the key. To try and get as much mileage as we can.\" The world champion added: \"It's incredible. And I've never seen anything like it. Just the strength of this car, it just keeps going and going and going. \"To think we won the two world championships and going into a third year you would think it is so easy to lose focus, but everyone has done an even better job with delivering the whole package.\" The Mercedes did not produce any stand-out lap times, but then that was not in the programme. Others were left to do that. Nevertheless, Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg made it clear they were not lacking for performance. \"I'm paying attention, of course,\" said Rosberg, who described the car as \"quick\". \"We have strategists and they're doing calculations already, so more or less we already know where we are, with a band of errors. \"Would you like to know? Sorry, I'm not going to say!\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner called Mercedes \"stand-out favourites\" on the first day of the test. Nothing that happened over the next three days made it feel like that analysis needed to be revised. Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel left the test with the fastest time - a one minute 22.801 seconds lap set on the second day on the new ultra-soft tyre. Indeed, Ferrari were fastest on three of the four days. Vettel's time was two seconds quicker than Mercedes' best, set by Rosberg on the medium tyre, which Pirelli estimates to be in the region of 1.8-2.3 seconds "}

The body that oversees Catholic education in Northern Ireland, the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS), has said all schools should remain open, if not for children, then for teachers and other staff who do not want to strike. However, with canteen and bus and train staff likely to take action, some schools have asked only senior and exam classes to come in, using alternative transport. They have told pupils to bring packed lunches as school catering staff may be involved in industrial action. Parents should liaise with schools regarding attendance on Friday and consider making alternative arrangements to get children to school where possible. There will be no Ulsterbus services on Friday except the express Belfast to Dublin service at 23:00 GMT. The air link buses that service George Best City Airport and Belfast International Airport will also not be running. No trains, local or Enterprise, will run either. Bus \u00c3\u2030ireann services between Belfast and Dublin will operate on Friday from Glengall Street (service marked BE above departure times).

The firms were quite right to be upset, the Supreme Court agreed, but then it got more complicated. The court hit a stumbling block over the amount of money the firms deserved in damages. The issue was that the judges couldn't determine precisely how valuable design was when compared with everything else that goes into making a nice carpet. A lovely design on a poor quality rug wouldn't sell, after all. And so it meant the companies got just six cents each. Which, even back then, was pitiful. Nominal damages. This caught the eye of Connecticut senator Orville Platt who, pressured by worried carpet makers, lobbied Congress to amend the Patent Act to make sure design patents were given more weight.

As evident on this board, the picture doesn't pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. To get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. I know, I know, that's hard to do when you consider Custer's Last Stand at the Little Big Horn and it's prominence in the history of post Civil War America. So I guess there's an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.<br /><br />There's a lot to take in here though for the picture's two hour plus run time. Custer's arrival at West Point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. The practical joke by Sharp (Arthur Kennedy) putting him up in the Major's headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.<br /><br />Ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in Custer's first meeting with Libby Bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader Callie (Hattie McDaniel).

She added: \"The jokes for Dave's Joke of the Fringe are submitted by 10 extremely experienced comedy critics from shows performed at the Edinburgh Fringe. \"Each submission is checked and cross-referenced for originality before being put to a public vote.\" Cunningham, who has a Fringe show at the Voodoo Rooms, told BBC Scotland that he and Walsh \"go back a few years\" and are \"always going backwards and forwards with comments and puns about each other's stuff\". The pair had a Twitter exchange in April of this year in which Cunningham tweeted the \"Hans free\" punchline, which he said he had first used as part of a routine by his Frank Sanazi character about seven or eight years ago. He added: \"Frank Sanazi is my most popular character and has a bit of a cult following. \"I was doing a gag seven or eight years ago - some new material.

Still, you can see large section of missing metal on G-61. Most likely metal fatigue, we'll talk about that a little below.What exactly happens, i.e. whether the part of the edge will break or fold to the side depends on the steel properties and Rockwell hardness. Harder the steel, higher the chance of chipping. Obviously it also depends on the force applied. For example, this photo of the edge on the 270mm Aritsugu A-Type Gyuto clearly shows the type of edge wear and dulling harder steel knives are prone to, it looks more like a micro saw under the microscope. Even if the steel isn't all that hard, 60-61HRC, still it fractures on microscopic level, and doesn't bend that much. Although, I don't want to give you an impression "}

They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula.
