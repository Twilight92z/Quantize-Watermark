UK Parliament boundaries are to be changed under plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600. No changes are to be made to the boundary of the Western Isles constituency, Na h-Eileanan an Iar. The three new Highlands constituencies are to be known as Argyll, Bute and Lochaber; Inverness and Skye; and Highland North. The seat of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is to be largely absorbed into the new Inverness and Skye. Part of Lochaber would form Argyll, Bute and Lochaber. Highland North would be the UK's largest-ever constituency, covering Caithness, Sutherland, Wester Ross and Easter Ross. Highland councillor Audrey Sinclair said it would be difficult for an MP to service such "}

Right-wing marchers carried banners including the North West National Front, neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18 and the Scottish Defence League. Counter-demonstrators included Kent Anti-Racism Network, anti-fascist group Antifa and people with Socialist Worker placards. Six men were also arrested at a service station on the M20, where several coaches were damaged. Eight of the men arrested have been bailed and one has been released without charge. Police seized weapons including a knife, a knuckle duster, poles adapted to cause harm, pieces of wood, glass, hammers and bricks at the two locations.

All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances.

Fat chance, huh?<br /><br />Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising \"\"Charlie's Team.\"\"<br /><br />The on-screen \"\"Team,\"\" is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them.

Granata and his partner, Jennifer Peaston, had met the backpacker at a party in November 2012 and invited her to their hotel room. The backpacker was forced to live in the shower. Granata, with the help of Peaston, beat the woman with various objects including a meat tenderiser and rolling pin, and performed bizarre rituals on her.

The SV3 incorporates the latest advancements in energy harvesting technology, providing the ability to use both wave and solar energy for forward propulsion, the company said. The systems could help scientists explore portions of the world's oceans in conditions that previously were too challenging or costly to operate.Whereas the original Wave Glider could take sensor readings, the SV3 can be packed with enough onboard hardware to process data at sea. The results are transmitted back to its headquarters, saving bandwidth and time. \"It's basically a floating server rack at sea,\" said Bill Vass, CEO of Liquid Robotics.The SV3 also improves on how the craft gets around. The original robot could harness ocean waves for propulsion, so it never had to stop for fuel.

Her aunt (Edna May Oliver--a person too talented for this film) didn't like Wheeler--a sentiment I can easily relate to. The aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from Wheeler. They left and Wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king. At about the same time, Woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king. So when Wheeler arrived, it was up to the boys to fight it out, but they refused because they are already friends--which greatly disappointed the people, as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of comedy from the Golden Age of Hollywood--the silent era through the 1940s. I have seen and reviewed hundreds, if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films I have never been able to understand the appeal of Wheeler and Woolsey--the only comedy team that might be as bad as the Ritz Brothers! Despite being very successful in their short careers in Hollywood (cut short due to the early death of Robert Woolsey), I can't help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better."}

A blog by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial condemned the theft. \"While we do not know who is behind the theft of the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an offensive attack on the memory of the Holocaust,\" it said.

Maria van der Hoeven told BBC News: \"People think about China in a way more representative of previous decades. \"They are now the largest wind power market in the world. They have increased their power generation from renewables from really nothing 10 years ago - and now it's 25%. These are very important signals that China is moving into the right direction.\" Her organisation - the rich countries' energy think-tank - says in 2014 that China spent more than $80bn in new renewables generating capacity; higher than the EU ($46bn); Japan ($37bn) and the USA ($34bn). China's commitment to renewables has benefited the rest of the world by creating a mass market that prompted a 70% reduction in the cost of solar panels in recent years. The country is also building 50 new nuclear power stations and creating economies of scale in nuclear too, the IEA says, at a time when the industry is moribund in Europe.

Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851, and achieved self-government in 1855. The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony, and by the Federation of Australia in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals.

My name is Austin Bingham, and welcome to the fifth module of Python: Beyond the Basics. In this module we'll look at string representations of objects in Python, and in particular we'll cover the important, but often confused differences between repr() and str(). Understanding and properly using the various string representations in Python is important for writing maintainable, debuggable, and human-friendly programs. In this module we'll show you what you need to know to use them properly. As you already know, Python supports two primary ways of making string representations of objects, the function's repr() and str(). Each of these can take any object as an argument and produce a string representation of some form. These two functions rely on the special methods dunder-repr and dunder-str to generate the strings they produce, and it's possible for class designers to control these string representations by defining those functions. Here's a quick example. Here the class Point2D defines both dunder-str, which returns a simple format, and dunder-repr, which returns a more complete unambiguous format. If we print both string representations, we can see how the free functions str() and repr() use these methods. So, the big question is why are there two representations, and what are they used for?Implementing CollectionsHello. My name is Robert Smallshire.

This manga diverges quite a bit from this \"expected\" storyline by making the relationship between misaki and kuroe a main part of this chronicle.As you continue to read this manga,you would probably be reminded a lot of the anime called Kure-nai (for those who have seen it) in which a young girl has feelings for her guardian who is significantly older. Kuroe so far only thinks of Misaki as a child and wants to protect her from the dangers of vampires with malicious intent.Another enjoyable part of this story is that as a viewer you would \"sometimes\" get to see the thoughts of Misaki and her feelings for Kuroe, which are further implied through her actions.

Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel. The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.<br /><br />Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film.

In fact, the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting.

He announced the \"largest state-backed\" housing programme since the 1970s. Addressing activists in Birmingham, Mr Javid said there had been \"massive progress\" since 2010 but there was still a \"long, long way to go\" and the simple fact was that too many people were priced out of housing market and had little chance of owning their home. The 170,000 homes built in England last year, he said, was simply not enough to keep up with demand. Pledging to tackle the obstacles to new schemes, he called on developers to \"release their stranglehold\" over land and stop building up so-called land banks. And targeting 'nimbyism' (which stands for 'not in my backyard') he said local communities had to reflect on the UK's national priorities not just their own. \"Everyone agrees we need more homes, but too many object to them being next to us,\" he said. \"We have got to change that attitude.

But many of them did not open because entrepreneurs were discovering a new niche. These trucks belong to people who have lost their jobs and used their compensation money to start a new business. In fact, on weekdays, most food trucks are just parked around town and closed as there aren't many customers. In just under two years, this city of 239,000 saw about 22,000 jobs disappear. Many of the unemployed who did not buy food trucks or venture into new business simply left town. Macae is one of the many cities on Brazil's south-east coast that has seen its dreams of oil-spurred wealth destroyed by the cruel reality of the country's oil crisis that started in 2014. Brazil's oil reserves are buried deep beneath the seabed, miles from the coast. So places like Macae are home to a large number of people who work on the offshore oil platforms and drilling ships. Since the 1970s, when Brazil's state oil giant Petrobras started its offshore operations here, this sleepy fishing town has seen an influx of highly skilled workers, such as engineers, chemists and professional divers. Anita Gomide and her husband started their commercial diving firm Tecsubsea in 2011 to service the oil platforms. During the good years, they would have up to two jobs a week - each of them requiring a team of at least three divers. But now they say they are lucky to get one job a month. \"Every six months we sit down and consider shutting down our company,\" says Anita. \"Then we decide, 'Let's just carry on for six months more and see what happens.' We've been doing this for a long time.\" Tecsubsea is still operating, but many of its competitors have dropped out. The upside of this crisis, Anita jokes, is that Macae is now a much nicer place to live, with less traffic and more affordable housing. At the local port, most commercial boats that service the oil industry are anchored in the dock. The only vessels in high demand are the fishing ones. Evanildo Faria, of Patricia Mar"}

Dressed in 'baby blue' outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home, the failed recruits are sent packing. Vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young Richard Gere who has just returned from a tour in the Pacific as a hard-core Marine 'Raider'. Gere's character is already jaded and contemplating desertion, and he takes advantage of Vincent's innocence, stealing his 'baby blue' uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway. Vincent's character, whose name is Marion, takes Gere's outfit and is suddenly transformed into a Marine 'Raider'. Marion hitch-hikes his way into Wyoming and stops at a little Norman Rockwell-like little town. In the local caf\u00e9 he meets Rose Hudkins, who immediately catches his eye. Staying with Hudkins parents, Marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks. Mr Hudkins suspects Marion and wonders how a Marine 'Raider' could still be so innocent. The story also brings up the Japanese Internment Camps, as the towns folks go 'hunting' 3 escapees. Marion is shot accidentally during this hunt. But there's still a happy ending, which befuddled me a bit. I would have preferred a little more drama! Anyway, this captures JMV at the peak of his 70's performances.

Art by TikitikWhat is Mix and Mega?In a nutshell, Mix and Mega is a metagame where any fully evolved OU-legal Pok\u00e9mon can hold any Mega Stone. Upon Mega Evolving, they get the stat, changes, new typing (if applicable), and ability that the stone would give the original holder. For example, the Altarianite gives Altaria base stats of 75/110/110/110/105/85, grants it a secondary Fairy typing, and changes its ability to Pixilate. This translates to a +40 boost to Attack, a +20 boost to Defense, and a +40 boost to Special Attack. So, if you gave Landorus-T the Altarianite, its base stats would become 89/185/110/145/80/91, it would become a Ground / Fairy-type, and it would gain Pixilate. Click here for an easy-to-view list of what Mega Stone does what. You activate the Mega Stone the same way you would ordinarily, by clicking the Mega Evolve button, and you can Mega Evolve as many Pok\u00e9mon on your team as you wish. The boosts remain until the Pok\u00e9mon faints. The Red Orb and Blue Orb activate immediately, as they would on Groudon and Kyogre. If a Mega Stone would take any of a Pok\u00e9mon's Base Stats above 255 or below 0, the Pok\u00e9mon can't use it. So Shuckle can't use the Sablenite, as it would take its Speed below 0 and its "}

The fraction 1/p expressed likewise in base q (rather than base 10) has similar effect, provided that p is not a prime factor of q. Wilson's theorem says that an integer p > 1 is prime if and only if the factorial (p \u2212 1)! + 1 is divisible by p.

However, it's a move that says a lot about the current condition of the Labour party. Labour's Tristram Hunt quits to head V&A Tristram Hunt would once have been called a Blairite. A thinker and historian who was close to Peter Mandelson and friends, long before he entered Parliament. Mr Hunt must have hoped for great things from his political career. He was made shadow education secretary by Ed Milband and thought about standing for the leadership when Mr Milband quit. He had pride and affection for his potteries' constituency but in Westminster cut a rather different figure from most. Academic, wry and detached. A book-writer not a ladder-climber.

Initially a summariser, he became a commentator in 1988 and remained with the corporation until 1999. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said he was \"very sad to hear of the death of a great cricketing servant and good friend\". Bannister became a bookmaker following his retirement as a player, a business taken over by his daughter when his media career took off. As well as being cricket correspondent of the Birmingham Post for over 20 years, covering mostly Warwickshire, as well as Worcestershire and England matches, he commentated for BBC radio and television. He was also instrumental in the formation of the Professional Cricketers' Association, having attended the inaugural meeting. Wolverhampton-born Bannister went on to serve the PCA as secretary, chairman and president for 20 years. He was also instrumental in setting up a pension scheme for county players. \"There is no denying that every cricketer owes Jack a huge debt of gratitude because he was one of the pioneers responsible for laying the foundations for the organisation we have now,\" said PCA assistant chief executive Jason Ratcliffe. \"Jack was always a players' man. He worked tirelessly to improve pay and conditions for players during his long association with the PCA. He was a fantastic cricketer with an outstanding record for Warwickshire. After he retired from playing, Jack became an influential figure in the broadcasting box from where he continued to promote the game he loved.\" Bannister "}
